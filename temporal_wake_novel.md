### CHAPTER ONE
#### Admiral Elena Vasquez
### Ares Prime - Earth Year 2087

The casualty reports arrived at 0400 hours, transmitted through military channels that had become the only reliable infrastructure left on Earth. Admiral Elena Vasquez stood in the command center three kilometers beneath what used to be São Paulo, watching the numbers tick upward on screens that glowed blue-white in the darkness. Twelve hundred dead. Fifteen hundred wounded. Unknown number missing, which really meant buried under rubble or dissolved in contaminated water.

All for an aquifer that would last six months.

She'd stopped feeling the numbers a decade ago. That was when she made captain, when she first had to sign death notifications with her own hand rather than just carry them up the chain. Now, as Admiral, the deaths were just data points in a larger calculation. Sector Seven lost. Brazilians gained temporary water access. Her forces would need to regroup, reassess, strike back before the enemy fortified their position.

This was how humans lived now. This was how they survived.

"Admiral." The voice came from behind her—Commander Hayes, her executive officer. Young, barely thirty, but he'd seen more combat than most soldiers saw in a lifetime. "Ares Prime reports ready for final crew boarding."

Vasquez turned from the screens. The command center was concrete and steel, built to survive direct nuclear strike. The air recyclers hummed constantly, a sound she'd lived with so long she only noticed it when they stopped. Fifty officers and analysts worked at their stations, monitoring conflicts across three continents. Wars for water, for arable land, for rare earth minerals, for anything that could keep their people alive another season.

She was leaving all of this behind.

"Status on the warp drive?" she asked.

Hayes pulled up a holographic display. "Dr. Webb reports exotic matter containment stable. Warp field generators tested and operational. We're one authorization away from launch."

One authorization. One command from her, and Ares Prime would leave Earth—leave this dying world and all its dying wars—and reach for something humanity hadn't touched in ten thousand years of evolution: a new world. A chance to start over. A chance to claim something before anyone else could.

"And the mission parameters are clear to all senior staff?"

"Crystal." Hayes met her eyes. "Reach Kepler-442b. Establish military control. Secure resources. Fortify against any competing claims."

Vasquez nodded. The mission was simple, even if the science that would get them there was anything but. She'd spent three months in briefings with physicists who spoke in mathematics she barely understood. Warp drive. Faster-than-light travel. Bending space itself so they could cross forty-seven light years in subjective weeks.

The Resource Wars would be over by the time they returned. One way or another.

But Kepler-442b would be theirs.

She looked around the command center one last time. These people—these soldiers and analysts and intelligence officers—they were fighting for survival. Nothing more noble than that. No grand ideology. Just the animal desperation to live another day, to secure another liter of water, another kilogram of food, another month of existence.

She'd been twenty-three when the wars started. She remembered different Earth—greener, bluer, more beautiful than any photograph could capture. She remembered her mother's garden, actual flowers growing in actual soil under actual sky. She remembered swimming in a river that wasn't poisoned. She remembered a world where people fought about ideas, not water.

That world was gone. This was what remained. Concrete bunkers and contaminated aquifers and casualty reports at 0400 hours.

"Prepare my transport," she said. "I'll board within the hour."

Hayes saluted. "Yes, Admiral."

She walked toward the elevator that would take her up to the surface, up to the launch facility where Ares Prime waited in its armored berth. Her boots echoed on the metal floor. Behind her, the analysts continued their work, tracking troop movements and water supplies and the ten thousand variables that meant life or death for millions.

In the elevator, alone, she allowed herself one moment of weakness. She pulled out a photograph—actual paper, ancient and precious—of her family. Her parents, dead twenty years. Her sister, lost in the Lima Collapse. Her nephew, who'd died at nineteen in a border skirmish over nothing that mattered.

She was the last one. The last Vasquez. The last memory of a family that had existed before the world ended.

She put the photograph away.

The elevator rose through three kilometers of earth and steel. When the doors opened, she stepped out into what passed for daylight—a gray-brown sky choked with dust, the sun a pale disc behind the haze. The air stung her lungs even through the respirator. She'd worn one so long she felt naked without it.

Ares Prime stood a kilometer away, surrounded by defense perimeters and guard towers. The ship was brutal in its efficiency—all angles and armor plating, weapons systems integrated into every surface. Gray and black, designed for war first and everything else second. It looked like what it was: humanity's fist, reaching for the stars.

Beautiful.

She rode in silence to the berth. Her security detail said nothing. There was nothing to say. Everyone here was a soldier. Everyone understood the mission. Everyone knew they were leaving Earth behind, possibly forever.

The warp drive worked—the tests proved that. But the temporal displacement was... uncertain. The physicists said time would pass differently for the ship and for Earth. They said the crew might experience weeks while Earth experienced years. Decades, even. There was no way to know until they jumped.

By the time Ares Prime returned to Earth, the Resource Wars might be over. Won, lost, or abandoned. Earth might be a garden again, or a graveyard.

It didn't matter. The mission mattered. Kepler-442b mattered. Claiming humanity's future mattered.

She boarded through the main airlock. Inside, the ship was cramped and utilitarian. Every cubic meter served a purpose—weapons, engines, life support, crew quarters barely large enough to sleep in. Two hundred soldiers and scientists, packed into a vessel designed for war.

Dr. Marcus Webb waited for her in the command deck. The scientist looked exhausted, his eyes sunken from weeks of final preparations. He was civilian technically, but he wore military gray like everyone else. On Ares Prime, everyone was military.

"Admiral," he said, voice hoarse. "All systems check out. We're ready."

She studied him. "You look like hell, Doctor."

"Haven't slept in forty hours. Wanted to run final calculations myself." He pulled up a holographic display showing mathematical models she couldn't decipher. "The warp field will contract space ahead of us, expand it behind. From our perspective, we'll cross forty-seven light years in about six weeks. But Earth..."

"Earth will experience more time. I know."

"We don't know how much more." Webb ran a hand through his gray-streaked hair. "Could be months. Could be years. Could be decades. The temporal displacement scales with distance, but the exact ratio... we're guessing."

"Educated guessing."

"Still guessing."

Vasquez sat in the command chair. It felt right—leather worn from testing, controls positioned perfectly for her reach. "Doctor Webb, I'm a soldier. I've guessed on battlefields where guessing wrong meant people died. I've ordered strikes based on intelligence that might have been wrong. I've made decisions with incomplete information every day for thirty years. This is just another mission."

Webb looked at her with something like wonder. "You really believe that."

"I have to."

He nodded slowly. "Then I'll believe it too."

The crew filtered onto the command deck—Hayes, Major Reeves from tactical, Lieutenant Chen from engineering, a dozen others whose lives were now bound to this ship. They took their stations without ceremony. Professionals doing professional work.

Vasquez opened the ship-wide comm.

"Ares Prime crew, this is Admiral Vasquez. In fifteen minutes, we'll initiate the first manned warp jump in human history. We're leaving Earth—the Earth we know—and reaching for something humanity has dreamed about since we first looked up at the stars. We're going to claim a new world. We're going to secure humanity's future. We're going to win."

She paused, choosing her next words carefully.

"I won't lie to you. We don't know exactly what we'll find at Kepler-442b. We don't know exactly when we'll return to Earth. But I know this: every person on this ship is here because they're the best at what they do. Every person on this ship is here because they understand what's at stake. We're not explorers. We're not scientists on some noble mission. We're soldiers. We're going to do what soldiers do—we're going to take ground and hold it."

She closed the comm.

Hayes looked at her. "Think they bought it?"

"Doesn't matter if they bought it. It's true."

"Is it?" The question came from Webb, quiet enough that only she and Hayes could hear.

Vasquez turned to him. "What else would we be, Doctor?"

"Refugees," he said. "Refugees who can never go home."

The words hung in the air like a curse.

"Thirty seconds to warp initialization," Chen reported from engineering.

Vasquez pushed Webb's words away. Refugees. No. Soldiers. Conquerors. Survivors. Anything but refugees.

"All stations report ready," Hayes said.

"Initiate warp drive on my mark," Vasquez ordered.

Webb took his station at the science console. His hands shook as they moved over the controls. Vasquez saw it but said nothing. She understood fear. Fear was human. Action despite fear—that was courage.

"Exotic matter containment stable," Webb reported. "Warp field generators charging. Space-time metrics nominal."

The ship hummed, a vibration that traveled through every bulkhead, every deck. Vasquez felt it in her bones. The hum built, deeper and deeper, until it was less sound than pressure.

"Warp field forming," Chen said. "Bubble stable."

Vasquez watched Earth on the viewscreen—gray and dying, shrouded in dust and regret. She thought of her family's photographs, sealed in her quarters. She thought of the casualty reports that would keep coming to the command center three kilometers below São Paulo. She thought of all the wars she'd fought, all the ground she'd taken, all the orders she'd given.

All of it would be gone in six weeks. Either because Earth would change, or because she would be too far away to matter.

"Mark," she said.

Webb initiated the warp sequence.

The universe folded.

For an instant—just an instant—Vasquez saw something impossible. Space itself bent around the ship, contracted ahead, expanded behind, and Ares Prime slipped through the gap between what was and what could be. Time stretched and compressed simultaneously. She felt her consciousness touch something vast and incomprehensible, something that made human wars and human suffering feel infinitesimally small.

Then it stopped.

The viewscreen showed stars. Different stars. Kepler-442's sun, a K-type orange dwarf, burned steady and close.

"Warp complete," Webb said, voice shaking. "We're... we're here. We did it."

The command deck erupted in cheers. Hayes was grinning. Chen looked like she might cry. Even the tactical officers—people trained to show nothing—were smiling.

Vasquez felt nothing but hollow certainty.

They'd left Earth behind. For better or worse, whatever came next, they were alone.

"Run full system diagnostics," she ordered. "Scan the local space. Find Kepler-442b. Let's see what we've won."

The celebration died as the crew returned to work. Professional. Efficient. Military.

Webb approached her station. "Admiral, I need to check something."

"What?"

"The temporal displacement. We need to see how much time passed on Earth."

Vasquez nodded. "Do it."

Webb worked at his console, running calculations based on Earth's stellar position, triangulating from known pulsars, analyzing light-speed communications signatures.

His face went pale.

"Doctor?"

"Forty-seven years," he whispered. "Earth-time. We experienced six weeks. Earth experienced forty-seven years."

Silence on the command deck.

"Everyone we knew is dead," someone said. Vasquez didn't see who.

Hayes recovered first. "Could they have won? Could the wars be over?"

Webb shook his head. "We can't know. We're forty-seven light-years away. Even if we could pick up their broadcasts, we'd be seeing Earth as it was when we left. Any news from the Earth we just created... it won't reach us for forty-seven years."

Reeves, the tactical officer, spoke up. "Then the mission hasn't changed. We're here. Kepler-442b is here. We do what we came to do."

Vasquez looked at her crew. Some were stunned. Some were crying. Some, like Reeves, had already moved past the shock to focus on the mission.

She'd led soldiers through worse.

"Reeves is right," she said, voice carrying through the command deck. "The mission hasn't changed. Everyone we left behind is gone, or might as well be. Everyone we left behind trusted us to do this. So we do it. We find Kepler-442b. We claim it. We build humanity's future. That's the mission. That's why we're here. Nothing else matters."

Hayes looked at her with something like desperation. "Admiral, do you really believe that? That nothing else matters?"

Vasquez met his eyes. "I have to, Commander. Because if I don't believe it, what do we have left?"

No one had an answer.

"Chen, continue system diagnostics," Vasquez ordered. "Webb, I want full astronomical survey. Reeves, tactical sweep—I want to know if we're alone out here. Hayes, coordinate crew rotations. I want everyone rested and ready within twenty-four hours. Move."

The crew moved. Orders were safety. Orders were purpose. Orders kept you from thinking about the fact that you'd just lost everyone and everything you'd ever known.

Vasquez sat in her command chair and watched Kepler-442's sun on the viewscreen.

Forty-seven years.

Her parents had been dead long before Ares Prime jumped. But her nephew—he'd have been sixty-six now. If he'd survived the wars. If.

She allowed herself sixty seconds of grief. Sixty seconds to feel the weight of what they'd lost. Then she locked it away, deep in the place where she kept all the things that would break her if she let them.

She was Admiral Elena Vasquez. She had a mission. She had a crew. She had a world to conquer.

That would have to be enough.

### CHAPTER TWO
#### Dr. Marcus Webb
### Ares Prime - Six Weeks Post-Arrival

Marcus Webb hadn't slept properly in four days. The nightmares had come back—equations that dissolved into screaming, warp fields that tore space into bleeding wounds, hands covered in blood that wouldn't wash away no matter how many times he tried.

Except the blood was real. Metaphorically real. He'd built the weapons systems on Ares Prime. He'd calculated the optimal yield for the kinetic impactors. He'd designed the targeting algorithms that would let them rain destruction on anyone who challenged their claim to Kepler-442b.

He was a physicist. He was supposed to explore the fundamental nature of reality. Instead, he'd become a weapons designer.

Again.

He sat in his quarters—barely larger than a closet, but private—and stared at his personal tablet. On the screen was his last message from Earth, sent three months before the launch. His wife, Keiko, smiling at the camera despite everything. Their home was in one of the protected zones, safe from the worst of the wars. She'd been a musician before the collapse. Now she grew vegetables in their basement and taught children in exchange for ration credits.

"I'm proud of you," she'd said in the video. "I know you don't believe that, but I am. You're giving humanity a chance. Maybe the mission isn't perfect. Maybe the methods aren't perfect. But you're trying. That's more than most people can say."

He'd watched that video two hundred times. Now, forty-seven years later, Keiko was either dead or nearly ninety years old. Either way, the woman in the video—young, smiling, proud of her husband—was gone.

A chime at his door interrupted his thoughts.

"Come in," he said, closing the tablet.

Admiral Vasquez entered. She looked tired but composed, always composed. Marcus wondered if she ever let herself fall apart or if the military training had made that impossible.

"Doctor Webb," she said. "Mind if I sit?"

"It's your ship, Admiral."

"It's our ship." She sat on the narrow bunk across from him. "You look terrible."

"Thank you. That's very encouraging."

"I need you functional. The warp drive needs maintenance, the exotic matter containment needs monitoring, and I need you to brief the science team on the Kepler-442 system survey results. Can you do that?"

Marcus rubbed his eyes. "Yes. I can do that."

"But you're not sleeping."

"No."

"Why not?"

He looked at her, this woman who'd sent twelve hundred people to their deaths over an aquifer, who'd ordered strikes on civilian populations during the Lima Collapse, who'd built a career on calculated violence.

"Because I built weapons," he said quietly. "Because I took the most beautiful mathematics in human history—the ability to bend space itself, to touch the fabric of reality—and I turned it into tools for killing. And I can't... I can't make peace with that."

Vasquez was quiet for a long moment. "You think I don't understand that?"

"I think you've made peace with violence in a way I never will."

"Made peace?" She almost laughed. "Doctor, I haven't had a peaceful night's sleep in twenty years. I see the faces of everyone who died under my command. I see the civilians in the crossfire. I see the enemy soldiers I killed who were just people trying to survive, same as us. I see all of it, every night. The only difference between you and me is that I don't let it stop me from doing my job."

"And what is your job now, Admiral? We're forty-seven light-years from Earth. The wars that made your job necessary might be over. They might have achieved peace. And here we are, a warship in a system that might not need one."

Vasquez stood. "My job is to protect this crew. My job is to complete the mission we were sent to accomplish. My job is to give humanity—whatever humanity has become in the last five decades—a foothold in this system. That's my job. What's yours?"

"I don't know anymore."

"Well, figure it out. Because in three hours, I need you on the command deck explaining why our long-range sensors are picking up an anomaly near Kepler-442b's third lagrange point."

Marcus sat up. "What kind of anomaly?"

"The artificial kind. The kind that suggests we might not be the first ship to arrive here."

His exhaustion vanished, replaced by pure scientific curiosity. "Another warp signature?"

"Could be. That's why I need you functional." Vasquez moved to the door, then paused. "Doctor Webb, you want to know what I think? I think you're a brilliant scientist who got drafted into a war you never wanted to fight. I think you did what you had to do to survive, same as all of us. And I think the best way to atone for the weapons you built is to use that brilliant mind for something better. We have a chance here—a chance to build instead of destroy. Don't waste it drowning in guilt."

She left before he could respond.

Marcus sat in silence, considering her words. Then he pulled up the sensor data on his tablet.

The anomaly was real. Definitely artificial. Definitely a warp signature, but the decay patterns were... off. Wrong. Like it had been generated by different technology or different calculations.

A ship. Another ship had been here. Possibly was still here.

Marcus felt something he hadn't felt in years: excitement. Pure, uncomplicated excitement at a scientific mystery.

If another ship was here, that meant either:
1. Another Earth faction had developed warp drive independently and reached Kepler-442 first, or
2. The temporal displacement was even less predictable than they'd thought, and a ship from Earth's future had somehow arrived here before them.

Either option was fascinating.

He cleaned himself up, drank something that was technically coffee, and headed to the command deck. The ship was quiet in the sleep cycle, only essential crew at their stations. Lieutenant Chen nodded at him from engineering. Reeves was at tactical, as always—Marcus suspected she never slept either.

Vasquez stood at the center of the command deck, studying holographic displays.

"Doctor," she greeted him. "Tell me what I'm looking at."

Marcus examined the data streams. "That's a warp signature, no question. But the exotic matter decay pattern doesn't match our drive's output. Different ratios, different energy distribution."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning it's not from Ares Prime. Someone else has warp drive, and they've been here."

"Recently?"

Marcus ran calculations. "Within the last two years, local time. The signature's still relatively fresh."

Hayes, who'd joined them, looked concerned. "Could be the Brazilians. Or the Chinese. We knew other nations were working on warp drive."

"Possible," Marcus agreed. "But look at this—" He pulled up a comparative analysis. "This signature is more advanced than ours. More efficient. Whoever built this drive had better understanding of the temporal mechanics than we did."

Vasquez's expression went cold. "You're saying someone from Earth's future arrived here before us."

"It's possible. If they launched after us but with more advanced technology, they might have experienced less temporal displacement. Or..." Marcus hesitated.

"Or what?"

"Or the temporal displacement isn't linear. If it compounds in unexpected ways, ships from different eras could arrive at roughly the same time, even if they left decades apart."

"Show me," Vasquez ordered.

Marcus pulled up a simulation. "Imagine time as a river. We entered at one point and crossed to another point downstream. But the river's current isn't constant—it eddies and swirls. Another ship entering at a different point might reach the same downstream location if they hit different currents."

"That's chaos," Reeves said. "How do we predict where we'll arrive?"

"We can't. Not precisely. The math is... it's beyond current physics. We're navigating blind."

The command deck fell silent as everyone processed the implications.

"So we could have ships from all across Earth's history potentially arriving here?" Hayes asked. "Ships from our past, our present, our future, all converging?"

"Theoretically," Marcus said. "Yes."

Vasquez turned to tactical. "Reeves, I want continuous monitoring of that anomaly point. If another ship arrives, I want to know immediately. Chen, prepare defensive protocols. Hayes, wake the senior staff. We need to discuss first contact procedures."

"First contact with ourselves," Marcus muttered.

Vasquez heard him. "What?"

"We always imagined first contact would be with aliens. We spent centuries wondering what we'd say when we met another intelligent species. Instead, we might be meeting ourselves. Different versions, from different times, with different politics and different technologies. We're not making first contact with an alien species—we're making first contact with our own scattered timeline."

"Is that poetic or horrifying?" Reeves asked.

"Both," Marcus said. "Definitely both."

Vasquez studied the star field on the viewscreen. "Doctor Webb, you asked what your job is now. Here's your answer: figure out how this works. Figure out the temporal mechanics. Because if ships from all across Earth's history are converging here, we need to understand why and how. That's pure science—no weapons, no war, just knowledge."

Marcus felt something unfamiliar: hope.

"I'll need access to all our warp drive data. And I'll need to analyze that anomaly more closely."

"You'll have whatever you need." Vasquez turned to face him fully. "And Doctor? If we encounter another ship, I need to know if they're friend or foe. I need to know what era they're from, what Earth they represent. Can you do that?"

"I can try."

"Good enough."

As the senior staff assembled and the command deck came alive with activity, Marcus returned to his console. He pulled up the warp field equations he'd derived, the ones that had enabled Ares Prime's journey. Somewhere in these mathematics was the answer to why humanity was scattering across time.

Somewhere in these equations was the key to understanding what they'd become.

For the first time since leaving Earth, Marcus Webb felt like a scientist again instead of a weapon designer. It was terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure.

He dove into the math, forgetting his exhaustion, forgetting his guilt, forgetting everything but the pure joy of discovery.

Outside the ship, the stars watched. And somewhere in the Kepler-442 system, another ship's signature pulsed like a heartbeat, waiting to be found.

### CHAPTER THREE
#### Colonel David Park
### Guardian Sentinel - Earth Year 2089

Colonel David Park stood on the observation deck of the Seoul Military Spaceport and watched Earth die.

Not dramatically. Not in fire or explosion. Just... fading. The sky was the color of old bruises. The ocean, visible in the distance, looked more gray than blue. Even the air tasted wrong—metallic and bitter despite the filters in his respirator.

He'd been born in this city forty-one years ago. He'd watched it transform from a gleaming metropolis to a fortress, from a center of culture to a bunker complex. The Seoul Incident two years ago—the reactor meltdown that had poisoned the harbor and killed sixty thousand people—had been the final blow.

His parents had died in that incident. His sister had survived but emigrated to one of the underground cities in Siberia. He hadn't spoken to her in eight months. Communication networks were spotty, resources were scarce, and everyone was too busy surviving to maintain relationships.

"Colonel." The voice belonged to Major Sarah Reeves, his tactical officer. She was younger than him—thirty-six—but she'd proven herself brilliant in simulation after simulation. On paper, she was a genius. In person, she made Park uncomfortable. She looked at people the way a chess master looked at pieces on a board.

"Major," he acknowledged.

"Guardian Sentinel is ready for crew boarding. Final preparations complete. We launch in six hours."

Park nodded, not taking his eyes from the dying city below. "And our mission parameters are understood by all senior staff?"

"Escort the colony ships to designated systems. Protect them from hostile forces. Establish forward military bases. Maintain Earth's territorial claims." She recited it like a catechism. "We're the shield, they're the seed. We defend while they grow."

"Poetic way to put it."

"It's accurate." Reeves moved to stand beside him. "Sir, I've run probability models on potential encounters. Based on intelligence reports, there's a seventy-eight percent chance we'll encounter hostile forces within the first five years of deployment."

"Seventy-eight percent," Park repeated. "You're that confident in your models?"

"The math doesn't lie."

"Math isn't people, Major. People are unpredictable."

"Respectfully, sir, that's not true. People are very predictable when you understand their incentives. Scarcity drives conflict. Competition drives aggression. Self-interest drives decision-making. Understanding those parameters means understanding human behavior."

Park finally turned to look at her. "Is that how you see people? As parameters?"

"It's how I win battles, sir. Emotion clouds judgment. Data clarifies it."

"And what does your data say about me?"

Reeves didn't hesitate. "You're an idealist trying to survive in a pragmatic world. You believe in duty and honor because they give meaning to violence. You're devastatingly competent, which is why you got command of Guardian Sentinel. But you're also haunted by every order you've ever given that got someone killed. You see this mission as a chance for redemption—protect instead of destroy. And you're afraid it won't work."

Park felt stripped bare. "You analyzed me?"

"I analyze everyone. It's my job."

"Your job is tactical assessment of enemy forces."

"Everyone is potentially an enemy, sir. Even allies, given the right circumstances."

"That's a bleak way to see the world, Major."

"It's an accurate way." She gestured toward the dying city. "The world is bleak. Pretending otherwise doesn't change reality."

Park wanted to argue, to defend some notion of human nobility or potential for good. But he'd seen too much. He'd given too many orders. He'd fought in three separate conflicts over resources that didn't matter anymore. He'd killed people who were just trying to survive, same as him.

Maybe Reeves was right. Maybe the world had beaten the idealism out of him, and what remained was just a soldier following orders.

"The colony ships we're escorting," he said, changing the subject. "Do we know their destinations?"

"Three vessels. Prometheus II heading for Kepler-442b. New Horizon heading for Proxima Centauri b. Hope's End heading for Tau Ceti e. All generation ships, designed for two-century journeys. No warp capability."

"And we're their escort for the entire journey?"

"Until we establish forward bases and confirm no hostile presence, yes. Then we have secondary orders—" Reeves pulled up a holographic display "—to explore, assess, and claim additional systems for Earth's expansion."

Park studied the star map. So many worlds. So much space. And humanity was reaching for it with the same desperate aggression they'd brought to Earth's resource wars.

"We're going to bring the wars with us," he said quietly. "Aren't we? We're going to spread across the galaxy and turn it into another battlefield."

Reeves looked at him with something like pity. "Yes, sir. We are. That's what humans do."

"Maybe it doesn't have to be that way."

"Math says it does. Resources are finite. Competition is inevitable. Conflict is the natural state. The only variable is who wins."

"I don't accept that."

"Doesn't matter if you accept it, sir. Reality doesn't require your consent."

Park wanted to argue, but the city below—poisoned and dying and still fighting over scraps—was evidence in Reeves' favor.

"Let's board the ship," he said.

Guardian Sentinel was even more brutal than Ares Prime in its design. It was built as a fortress—heavy armor plating, redundant systems, weapons ports covering every angle. The ship could take punishment and keep fighting. It could defend the slower colony ships against anything Earth's intelligence suggested they might encounter.

It was also designed for long-term deployment. Crew quarters were slightly larger, life support more robust, recreational facilities actually existed. The crew of four hundred would be living on this ship for years, possibly decades.

Park's quarters were austere but comfortable—more space than he'd had on Earth, honestly. A bunk, a desk, a small common area. Windows showed the stars, when they weren't in port. It would be home for a very long time.

His terminal chimed with an incoming message. Chaplain Thomas Osei wanted to speak with him before launch.

Park sighed. He wasn't religious, but he respected Osei. The man had been a combat medic before taking up the chaplaincy. He'd seen as much death as any soldier, but somehow retained faith in something larger.

"Enter," Park called when the door chime sounded.

Osei was a solid man, Nigerian by birth, with kind eyes that had seen too much. "Colonel Park. I won't take much of your time. I know you're busy."

"Chaplain. What can I do for you?"

"I wanted to give you this." Osei held out a small data chip. "It's a collection of texts—religious, philosophical, poetic. Things to read when the stars feel too far away. Things to remember that we're still human, even out here."

Park took the chip. "Thank you. I appreciate it."

"May I speak honestly, Colonel?"

"Always."

"This mission troubles me. We're being sent to protect people, but we're also being sent to claim territory. We're being told to defend, but also to establish military dominance. There's a contradiction there that concerns me."

"The contradiction is war itself," Park said. "Defense and offense are just perspectives. We're soldiers. We don't get to choose our contradictions."

"Don't we? The moment we stop questioning our orders is the moment we stop being moral agents. We become just... tools. Weapons."

Park thought about that. "Would you refuse the mission?"

"No. These people need protection. The colony ships are defenseless. Someone has to guard them. But I wanted to say, before we leave—remember that we're more than just weapons. We're people. We carry moral weight. Our choices matter."

"I'll remember," Park promised.

Osei smiled sadly. "I hope so. Because I've seen what happens when soldiers forget their humanity. We're capable of terrible things, Colonel. Necessary things, maybe. But still terrible."

After Osei left, Park sat at his desk and inserted the data chip. Hundreds of texts loaded—poetry, philosophy, scripture from a dozen religions. He opened one at random, a poem by someone named Mary Oliver, written more than a century ago:

*Tell me, what is it you plan to do*
*with your one wild and precious life?*

Park closed the file.

What was he planning to do? Follow orders. Protect people who needed protecting. Try not to think too hard about the people he'd already failed to protect.

One wild and precious life. He'd given his to military service, to duty, to the endless grinding machinery of war. Was that enough? Was that meaningful?

He didn't know.

Six hours later, Guardian Sentinel launched. The colony ships—massive, slow, generation vessels carrying ten thousand people each—moved into formation behind them. Park watched from the command deck as Earth receded, as the dying blue-gray marble grew smaller and smaller until it was just another dot among the stars.

Major Reeves stood at tactical. "Course laid in for Kepler-442b. Estimated journey time: two weeks subjective, approximately forty-five to fifty years objective."

"Fifty years," Park repeated. "Everyone we know will be dead or elderly when we arrive."

"Yes, sir."

"And the colony ships?"

"They'll arrive approximately twenty years after we do, local time. Their generation drives are slower, but they don't experience the same temporal displacement. It's... complicated."

Park didn't understand the mathematics. He just understood the reality: they were leaving everything behind. Forever.

"Initiate warp sequence," he ordered.

The ship hummed. The universe folded. Time and space twisted into shapes his mind couldn't comprehend.

And then they were through.

Stars. Different stars. Kepler-442's sun, bright and orange in the viewscreen.

"Warp successful," the navigator reported. "All systems nominal. Temporal displacement... calculating... approximately forty-seven years, give or take six months."

Forty-seven years. Park's sister would be seventy-nine years old. If she'd survived. If anyone had survived.

"Run full system scan," he ordered, pushing the grief away. "Locate Kepler-442b. Find a stable orbit for the initial base. And scan for any signs of—"

"Contact!" Reeves shouted. "Ship detected in system. Repeat, ship detected. Transponder identifies it as Ares Prime, Earth vessel, military designation."

Park felt his heart stop. "Ares Prime? That launched two years before us."

"Confirmed, sir. And there's more—I'm detecting another warp signature. Fresh one. And another. And... sir, I'm reading at least three distinct warp signatures in this system, all from Earth vessels, all from different time periods based on the drive signatures."

"How is that possible?"

"I don't know, sir. But we're not alone here. And we're not the first to arrive."

Park stared at the viewscreen, at the stars that should have been empty, at the system that should have been theirs to claim.

"Signal Ares Prime," he said. "Request communication. And Reeves—"

"Sir?"

"Get me a full tactical assessment. If there are multiple Earth ships here, all from different eras, all with different missions... we might not all be on the same side anymore."

Reeves nodded, understanding immediately. "Yes, sir. Running probability models now."

As Guardian Sentinel moved deeper into the Kepler-442 system, as the colony ships they were meant to protect crawled through space years behind them, Park realized something terrible:

His mission was already obsolete.

The ships he was supposed to escort would arrive decades from now. By then, Kepler-442b would already be claimed, already fought over, already divided among whatever factions had arrived first.

He'd given everything to protect people who wouldn't need him. He'd sacrificed everything for a mission that didn't matter.

What was he supposed to do now?

The poem echoed in his mind: *What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?*

He'd planned to serve. To protect. To give his life meaning through duty.

But what did duty mean when your mission was meaningless?

Park didn't have an answer. He sat in the command chair and watched the viewscreen and waited for Ares Prime to respond to their hail, knowing that whatever came next, nothing would be what they'd expected.

Nothing ever was.

### CHAPTER FOUR
#### Dr. Yuki Kaito
### Odyssey Venture - Earth Year 2134

Dr. Yuki Kaito stood in the botanical garden on the observation level of the Yokohama Spaceport and felt the sun on his face—real sunlight, not filtered through dust or ash or chemical haze. He closed his eyes and breathed air that didn't need a respirator, that smelled of growing things instead of decay.

Earth had healed.

Not completely. The scars from the Resource Wars were still visible—coastlines redrawn by rising seas, deserts where forests once stood, species driven extinct. But humanity had learned. After the wars exhausted themselves, after the last soldier stood over the last ruined aquifer and realized there was nothing left to fight for, humanity had finally chosen a different path.

It had taken three decades. Three decades of painful reconciliation, of building trust where none existed, of learning to share instead of hoard. The fusion breakthrough had helped—cheap, clean energy had eliminated one source of conflict. The atmospheric cleaning technologies had helped—the sky was blue again, properly blue, for the first time in Kaito's adult life.

But more than technology, what had changed was philosophy. Humanity had looked at what they'd become during the wars and decided, collectively and painfully, to become something better.

Kaito opened his eyes and looked at the garden. Roses grew here—actual roses, not the hardy desert scrub that had survived the collapse. Cherry trees bloomed, their petals drifting on clean wind. Children played on the grass, laughing, not afraid.

His partner, Tomás, sat on a bench nearby, sketching the trees. He was an artist, one of millions who'd found space to create after the wars ended. During the conflicts, art had been a luxury. Now it was seen as essential—a reminder that humans were more than just survival machines.

"Beautiful day," Tomás said without looking up from his drawing.

"Beautiful world," Kaito agreed. "I almost forgot what it could be like."

"And you're leaving it."

The words carried no accusation, just statement of fact. But they stung anyway.

"Not leaving," Kaito said. "Expanding. Taking this—" he gestured at the garden, the clean sky, the laughing children "—and sharing it. Spreading it."

"Do you think they'll want it? The people you find out there?"

"If there are people out there. We don't know yet."

"But you hope."

"I hope."

Kaito had spent his career studying xenobiology—the theoretical biology of life that evolved on other worlds. It was a field built entirely on hope and speculation. Humans had detected biosignatures on dozens of exoplanets, hints that life existed beyond Earth. But they'd never made contact. Never found proof of intelligence beyond humanity.

Odyssey Venture was going to change that.

The ship was beautiful—nothing like the brutal military vessels from the war era. It was elegant, modular, with extensive observation decks and laboratories. Living sections included gardens, art galleries, even a small concert hall. The ship was designed for long-term exploration, for a crew that would be living together for subjective years.

Most importantly, it was designed for peace. Odyssey Venture carried no weapons. None. It was a statement of faith—we come in peace, and we trust the universe to respond in kind.

Some called it naive. Kaito called it necessary.

"The military planners wanted us to bring defensive systems," he said to Tomás. "Just in case. But the Council voted against it. We're not going out there to fight. We're going to understand."

"And if what you find doesn't want to be understood?"

"Then we'll learn that too. We'll learn and we'll adapt and we'll respond with compassion instead of violence."

Tomás set down his sketchpad. "I love your idealism. I'm terrified by it too."

"I know."

"Promise me something?"

"Anything."

"If you find something dangerous out there, you'll run. You won't try to understand the thing that's trying to kill you. You'll run and you'll come home."

Kaito sat beside him and took his hand. "I promise I'll be careful. I promise I'll prioritize the crew's safety. But I can't promise to run from danger. Sometimes the most dangerous thing is ignorance. Sometimes the only way to be safe is to understand."

"That sounds like something a dead scientist would say."

"Or a live one who learned something important."

Tomás kissed him—soft, gentle, tasting of goodbye. "I hate that you're going."

"I know."

"But I understand why you have to."

"I know that too."

They sat in silence, holding hands, watching the cherry blossoms fall. In three hours, Kaito would board Odyssey Venture. In six hours, the ship would leave Earth orbit and warp to Kepler-442b. And in forty-seven years—Earth time—this moment would be ancient history.

Tomás would be ninety-three years old. If he lived that long.

Kaito would be the same age he was now, having experienced only weeks of subjective time.

The temporal displacement was the cruelest part of warp travel. You didn't just leave your world—you left your time. Everyone you loved would age, change, potentially die while you experienced mere weeks.

"Will you wait for me?" Kaito asked quietly.

Tomás considered the question seriously. "I don't know. Forty-seven years is a lifetime. I might meet someone else. I might die. I might change so much that the person you come back to isn't the person you left. Would you want me to wait, knowing that?"

"I want you to live. I want you to be happy. I want you to create beautiful art and find joy and experience everything this healed world has to offer."

"Then that's what I'll do. And if you come back, and I'm still here, we'll figure out what that means. Deal?"

"Deal."

Another kiss, deeper this time, full of all the things they weren't saying. All the fears. All the hopes. All the love that would have to span decades they wouldn't share.

Then Kaito stood, shouldered his bag, and walked toward the transport that would take him to Odyssey Venture.

He didn't look back. He couldn't. If he looked back, he might not leave.

The ship was magnificent. Sleek white hull, transparent sections showing the gardens and laboratories inside. It looked more like a university than a warship—which was exactly the point.

Captain Sato greeted him at the airlock—a civilian designation, not military. "Dr. Kaito. Welcome aboard. Ready to make history?"

"Ready to try."

The crew was sixty strong—scientists, engineers, cultural anthropologists, linguists, artists. No soldiers. No weapons specialists. No tactical officers. Just people who wanted to understand the universe.

Lieutenant Amara Okonkwo, the chief engineer, gave him a tour. She was young—twenty-nine—and brilliant, with quick eyes that missed nothing.

"You'll love the lab spaces," she said, guiding him through the ship. "Fully modular, adaptable to whatever we encounter. Spectrographic analysis, genetic sequencing, atmospheric modeling—we've got everything."

"What about first contact protocols?" Kaito asked.

"Ah, that's your department. We've got the communication arrays ready. Multi-spectrum transmission, pattern analysis, symbolic representation systems. If there's intelligence out there, we'll find a way to talk to it."

They passed through a garden section—actual trees growing in engineered soil, recycling the air, providing food and psychological comfort. It reminded Kaito of the garden at Yokohama.

"This is incredible," he said.

"Engineering loves a challenge. Growing things in space, making them thrive—it's the same principle as making humans thrive. Provide the right conditions, support the right processes, let life do what life does."

"You're a poet, Lieutenant."

"I'm an engineer. But sometimes the math is poetic."

The command deck was open and bright, nothing like the cramped military bridges Kaito had seen in historical recordings. Large windows showed the stars. Stations were arranged in a circle, emphasizing collaboration over hierarchy.

Dr. Priya Venkataraman, their cultural anthropologist, was already at her station. "Dr. Kaito! I've been reading your papers on universal ethics. Fascinating work. The idea that moral reasoning might follow mathematical principles accessible to any sufficiently advanced intelligence—it's brilliant."

"It's speculative," Kaito demurred. "We won't know until we meet someone else to test it against."

"But that's why we're here, isn't it? To test our grandest theories against reality. To see if our hopes about the universe are justified."

"Or to learn that they're not. That's valid too."

"You're more pragmatic than your reputation suggests."

"I'm optimistic about possibilities, pragmatic about outcomes. I hope we find intelligence. I hope we can communicate. I hope the universe is fundamentally cooperative rather than competitive. But I'm prepared to be wrong."

Captain Sato called the crew to attention. "All personnel, this is the Captain. Final boarding complete. All systems check green. We launch in thirty minutes. This is the first crewed exploration vessel launched under the Reconciliation Accords. We represent not just Earth, but what Earth has chosen to become—curious, peaceful, and open to whatever we find. Let's make this count."

Kaito took his station at xenobiology. Around him, the crew prepared for launch with calm efficiency. No military precision, no barked orders—just skilled people doing skilled work.

Through the windows, Earth hung in the darkness—blue and green and beautiful. Healed. Hopeful.

Worth protecting. Worth sharing.

The ship detached from the port. Thrusters fired, gentle and precise. They moved away from Earth, away from the Moon, out toward the edge of the solar system where they could safely initiate warp.

"Everyone ready?" Sato asked.

A chorus of affirmatives.

"Then let's go meet the universe. Initiate warp sequence."

The ship hummed—not the aggressive roar of military drives, but a gentle vibration that Kaito felt in his bones. The warp field formed, space contracted, and Odyssey Venture slipped between one moment and the next.

The transition was smooth, almost gentle. Kaito experienced a moment of vertigo, a sense of impossible distance crossed instantaneously, and then—

Stars. Different stars. Kepler-442's sun, warm and orange.

"Warp successful," Okonkwo reported. "All systems nominal. We're here."

"Run astronomical survey," Sato ordered. "Let's see what we've found."

The sensors activated, scanning the system. Kaito watched the data flow across his screens—planetary masses, atmospheric compositions, electromagnetic signatures.

Then the alarms went off.

"Contact!" Venkataraman called out. "Multiple contacts. Ship signatures. Earth vessels, based on the transponder codes. But... that's not possible. These are from different launch eras. Decades apart."

Kaito felt his heart race. "How many ships?"

"I'm reading at least three distinct signatures. One military vessel, pre-Reconciliation era. One that might be contemporary with us. And traces of others—old signatures, like ships passed through recently."

"Are they hostile?"

"Unknown. But Dr. Kaito—" Venkataraman turned to face him, eyes wide "—we're not making first contact with aliens. We're making first contact with ourselves. Ships from Earth's past, Earth's present, maybe Earth's future. All converging here."

Kaito stared at the viewscreen, at the system that was supposed to be empty.

This changed everything.

They'd come to find aliens, to test their theories about universal understanding and cooperation. Instead, they'd found something more challenging:

Multiple versions of humanity, representing different eras, different philosophies, different Earths.

"Open all communication channels," Kaito said. "Broadcast peaceful intentions on all frequencies. And someone get me detailed analysis on those signatures. I need to know when these ships left Earth, what their missions were, what version of humanity they represent."

Because if ships from the Resource Wars era were here—ships built for conquest and conflict—Odyssey Venture's idealistic mission of peaceful exploration might not be welcomed.

They might have found not a universe waiting to be understood, but a war waiting to resume.

Kaito thought of Tomás, of the garden, of the healed Earth they'd left behind.

Then he pushed the fear away and focused on the task ahead.

They'd come to communicate, to understand, to bridge differences.

Whether those differences were between species or between eras didn't matter.

The mission was the same.

"Let's introduce ourselves," he said. "Let's show them what Earth became. What we all could become. Together."

Odyssey Venture moved deeper into the Kepler-442 system, broadcasting peace on every frequency, hoping the ships ahead would listen.

Hoping that humanity, meeting itself across time, could choose understanding over conflict.

It was, Kaito thought, the test of everything the Reconciliation had tried to build.

He just hoped they'd pass it.

### CHAPTER FIVE
#### Commander Aria Chen
### Celestial Bloom - Earth Year 2156

Aria Chen was born in a spaceship, lived her entire life in a spaceship, and would die in a spaceship. She'd never breathed unfiltered air. Never felt rain. Never walked on soil that wasn't cultivated in a hydroponics bay.

Earth was a story told by grandparents, a myth made of old videos and fading photographs.

She was okay with that.

"Commander Chen," Dr. Jonas Hartmann's voice crackled over the comm, warm with familiarity. "We've got the morning harvest numbers. Tomatoes are exceeding yield projections by twelve percent. The apple trees in Section Seven are flowering—we should have fruit in four months."

"Good news for once," Aria said, smiling despite the exhaustion that came from managing a ship-city of twelve thousand people. "Send the surplus to pediatrics. Growing kids need the vitamins."

She stood in her quarters—barely larger than the crew quarters on Ares Prime, but she didn't know that, having no frame of reference. To her, this was luxury. A private space. A window showing the stars. A small shelf with photographs of her parents and grandparents, all born on Celestial Bloom, all having died here.

The ship was home. The only home she'd ever known.

Celestial Bloom had been built as a generation ship—designed to carry ten thousand colonists on a two-hundred-year journey to Kepler-442b. Families would board, live, die. Their children would be born in space, live, die. Eventually, their great-great-great-grandchildren would arrive at the destination and establish humanity's first extrasolar colony.

That was the plan.

Then, forty years into construction, Earth developed the warp drive.

The ship's designers had a choice: retrofit the generation ship with warp capability, turning a two-hundred-year journey into a six-week subjective trip, or continue as planned with conventional drives.

The colonists voted. Most wanted the warp drive. Some wanted to continue as planned—arguing that the journey was as important as the destination, that the generations born in space deserved to fulfill their mission.

Aria's grandparents had been in the second group. They'd volunteered for the generation ship knowing they'd never see the destination. They'd made peace with that. The warp drive felt like cheating, like abandoning the covenant they'd made with their descendants.

But they were outvoted. Celestial Bloom was retrofitted. Warp nacelles were added to the ship's hull, exotic matter reactors integrated into the power systems. The mission changed from generational to expeditionary.

And everyone who'd been born on the ship during the forty years of construction became something strange: spacers who would arrive at their destination while relatives on Earth aged decades.

Aria was thirty-three. She'd been born seven years before the launch, while Celestial Bloom was still being assembled in Earth orbit. Her parents had been engineers—born on Earth, volunteered for the colony mission. They'd raised her in the rotating habitats, in the gardens, teaching her about a planet she'd never seen.

"Tell me about Earth," she'd asked as a child.

"It's blue," her mother had said. "Blue like nothing you've seen. Blue like the ocean that covers most of it. Blue like hope."

"Why did you leave?"

"We didn't leave. We expanded. Earth was healing, recovering from the wars. We wanted to take that healing, that hope, and spread it. Plant it somewhere new. Make humanity a garden species instead of a locust species."

Aria had loved that phrase. Garden species. Tending growth instead of consuming resources.

That's what Celestial Bloom was supposed to be: a seed ship, carrying culture and biology and hope to a new world.

Now, at thirty-three, Aria was the Commander—youngest in the ship's history. She'd been elected by the crew three years ago, after the previous Commander died of a heart condition. The role was part mayor, part captain, part parent to a ship full of people who'd never known any other home.

"Commander," another voice on the comm, this one belonging to Chief Engineer Sato Kimura, "we're approaching optimal warp window. All systems green. We can jump within the hour."

Finally. They'd been preparing for this moment for years—running tests, refining calculations, ensuring the warp drive that had been grafted onto their generation ship would actually work.

"All hands, this is Commander Chen," Aria broadcast ship-wide. "We're going to jump in one hour. Find somewhere comfortable. Make sure children are secured. This is going to be strange, but it'll be quick. By tonight, we'll be at Kepler-442b. By tonight, we'll be home."

She made her way through the ship to the command center—less a military bridge, more a civic coordination hub. Screens showed the ship's systems, population distribution, resource allocation. It looked more like a city planning office than a spacecraft control room.

Dr. Hartmann was there, looking frail but excited. He was fifty-five, one of the oldest people on the ship, and one of the few born on Earth. He remembered the planet—actually remembered it, not just from stories.

"Jonas," Aria greeted him. "How are you feeling?"

"Old. Nervous. Excited. Terrified. The usual." He smiled, the expression crinkling the corners of his eyes. "I left Earth in 2131. I've been on this ship for twenty-five years. Most of my life spent in metal halls and recycled air. But I remember Earth—I remember trees that weren't cultivated, skies that weren't simulated, oceans that stretched to the horizon. And now we're going to a new world, a fresh start, and I might actually live to see it."

"You'll see it," Aria promised. "We all will."

"Do you think it'll be empty? Kepler-442b? Just us, pristine world, clean slate?"

"I hope so. But I've been reading the stellar drift calculations. Other ships might have reached it first. Ships from earlier eras, before the warp drive was perfected. We might not be alone."

"Would that be so bad? Meeting other humans? Other Earth colonies?"

"Depends on which Earth they're from. Which era. The Resource Wars Earth or the Reconciliation Earth or something else entirely. We're from a peaceful era, Jonas. Not everyone is."

He nodded slowly. "I remember both. I was young during the tail end of the wars. I remember the desperation, the violence, the sense that humanity was tearing itself apart. Then I remember the slow healing, the reconstruction, the decision to become something better. If we meet ships from the war era..."

"Then we show them what we became. We show them that the wars ended, that humanity chose peace, that another way is possible."

"And if they don't want to hear it?"

Aria thought about that. Celestial Bloom had no weapons. No military capabilities. It was a ship built for growing things, not fighting.

"Then we'll have to hope our words are enough."

The countdown began. The crew took their positions—not military stations, but coordination posts. Engineers monitored the warp drive. Medical personnel stood ready for any temporal displacement sickness. Cultural liaisons prepared to document the historic moment.

This wasn't a military operation. This was a community embarking together.

"One minute to warp," Kimura announced.

Aria sat in the commander's chair—comfortable, well-worn, designed for long hours of coordination work. Around her, the command center hummed with quiet activity.

"Thirty seconds."

She thought about her parents, buried in the ship's memorial garden. They'd died before the warp drive was completed—never got to see the mission fulfilled. But they'd believed in it. Believed in humanity's potential to grow instead of consume, to plant instead of extract.

"Ten seconds."

This was for them. For everyone who'd believed that humans could be better.

"Mark."

The universe folded.

Aria experienced something impossible—space contracting, time dilating, her consciousness stretched across forty-seven light-years in an instant. She saw the ship from outside, saw it slip through a gap in reality, saw stars blur and bend and—

Normal space. Kepler-442's sun, bright and welcoming.

"Warp successful!" Kimura cheered. "All systems nominal! We made it!"

The command center erupted in celebration. People hugging, crying, laughing. Aria felt tears on her own cheeks and didn't care.

They'd made it. After twenty-five years of preparation, after forty years of construction, after a dream that spanned generations—they'd made it.

"Run system scan," she ordered once the celebration died down. "Find Kepler-442b. Find our new home."

The sensors activated. Data streamed across the screens.

Then someone gasped.

"Commander," the sensor technician said, voice shaking, "I'm reading multiple ship signatures in system. Human ships. Lots of them. And... and I'm picking up settlement signatures on Kepler-442b itself. Established structures. Power generation. Agriculture."

"What?" Aria moved to the sensor station. "That's not possible. We should be the first."

"We're not. Commander, I'm reading at least five distinct ship signatures. And the settlement on the planet... based on the power output and construction patterns, it's been there for years. Maybe decades."

Aria stared at the data, trying to process it.

They weren't colonizing a pristine world. They were arriving at an established system. Other humans—from Earth, but from different eras—had already claimed Kepler-442b.

"Can you identify the ships?" she asked.

"Working on it... okay, I've got partial transponder data. One military vessel, designation Ares Prime, launched 2087. Another military vessel, Guardian Sentinel, launched 2089. One science vessel, Odyssey Venture, launched 2134. And there are others—I'm seeing warp signatures suggesting many more ships passed through recently."

"2087?" Hartmann said quietly. "That's Resource Wars era. Before the Reconciliation. Before peace."

"And we're from 2156," Aria said. "We're from a post-scarcity Earth where conflicts over resources are ancient history. But those ships..."

"Those ships are from when Earth was dying. When humans fought over water. When survival meant conquest."

The reality settled over the command center like a weight.

They'd come to plant a garden. But the field was already contested.

"Try to hail them," Aria ordered. "Broadcast our mission parameters. Make it clear we're not military, not a threat. We're colonists. We're here to build, not fight."

"Commander," the communications officer said, "I'm receiving a transmission. It's... it's a welcome message. From something called the Kepler Accord. They're inviting us to send a representative to the planetary surface. They say there's a summit in progress—multiple Earth factions trying to establish peaceful coexistence protocols."

"Multiple factions?"

"That's what it says."

Aria looked at Hartmann. "What do we do?"

The old man smiled sadly. "We do what we came to do. We meet our fellow humans. We share what we learned—that peace is possible, that cooperation works, that humanity can choose to be better. And we hope they listen."

"And if they don't?"

"Then we plant our garden anyway. We show by example. We prove that another way works."

Aria took a breath. This wasn't the mission they'd planned. But maybe it was the mission they needed.

"Prepare a delegation," she said. "I'm going down to meet them. I'm going to show them what Earth became after they left. I'm going to show them that the future doesn't have to be war."

As Celestial Bloom moved deeper into the Kepler-442 system, as Aria prepared to meet humans from her planet's past and present, she thought about her mother's words:

*We wanted to make humanity a garden species instead of a locust species.*

Maybe that's what the Kepler Accord was trying to do. Maybe that's what all of them, across all the different eras and philosophies, were struggling toward.

The garden wasn't pristine and empty.

But gardens rarely were.

They were messy, complex, full of competing species trying to coexist.

That didn't make them less beautiful.

It made them more real.
