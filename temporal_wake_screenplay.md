## ACT ONE: DEPARTURE POINTS

## OPENING SEQUENCE

FADE IN:

EXT. EARTH - SPACE - 2087

The planet is gray and brown. Cloud cover obscures much of the surface. Dust storms rage across continents. The blue has faded.

SUPER: "EARTH, 2087 - THE RESOURCE WARS"

We push through the murky atmosphere.

INT. MILITARY COMMAND CENTER - SOUTH AMERICA - DAY

Concrete bunker. Harsh fluorescent lights. Screens show casualty reports, territory maps with shifting borders. Water supply projections - all declining.

ADMIRAL ELENA VASQUEZ (52, sharp-eyed, military bearing that's become her entire identity) stands before a holographic display. She's in dress uniform - medals earned through blood.

VASQUEZ
(to assembled officers)
Sector Seven fell last night. The Brazilians took the aquifer. Twelve hundred dead for water that'll last them six months.

She taps the display. A new star map appears.

VASQUEZ (CONT'D)
This is Kepler-442. Habitable. Abundant water. And no one has claimed it yet.

The officers lean forward.

VASQUEZ (CONT'D)
The warp drive works. Our intelligence says three other nations have it too. Whoever gets there first owns it. And I intend for that to be us.

COLONEL MARCUS WEBB (38, intelligent eyes that carry guilt) stands at the back of the room. His hand trembles slightly as he holds a data pad.

WEBB
Admiral, the temporal displacement calculations--

VASQUEZ
(cutting him off)
Are acceptable losses, Colonel. Brief the crew. We launch at 0600.

Webb's face shows he wants to argue. He doesn't.

INT. WEBB'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Small, utilitarian. Webb sits at a desk covered in equations. His screen shows weapons schematics - his designs. In the corner, a photo of younger Webb in academic robes, smiling. That man is gone.

He pulls up a video file marked "CONFIDENTIAL - WARP WEAPONS PROTOCOLS."

His own face looks back at him from the recording.

WEBB (ON SCREEN)
The spatial compression field can be weaponized. By collapsing the warp bubble while overlapping a target's position...

Present Webb pauses the video. He can't watch himself explain how to kill with his discovery.

He closes the file and opens another - temporal displacement calculations.

WEBB
(to himself)
Forty-seven years. We'll lose forty-seven years.

He looks at the photo on his desk - a woman, smiling. 

WEBB (CONT'D)
(whisper)
I'm sorry.

He closes his eyes. The mathematics don't lie.

EXT. LAUNCH FACILITY - DAWN

Through the gray atmosphere, the sun rises pale and distant. 

ARES PRIME sits on the launch pad - brutal, angular, gray metal. No elegance. This is a weapons platform with engines. Gun ports visible along every surface.

Ground crew swarms around it. Military precision.

INT. ARES PRIME - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Vasquez takes her command chair. The bridge is cramped, efficient, lit in harsh white light. Every surface is metal and purpose.

VASQUEZ
All stations, report.

HELM OFFICER
Navigation locked. Kepler-442 coordinates confirmed.

WEAPONS OFFICER
All systems armed and ready.

Webb sits at the science station, surrounded by screens of data.

WEBB
Warp drive charged. Exotic matter containment stable.

Vasquez nods. She activates ship-wide comms.

VASQUEZ
This is Admiral Vasquez. We are the vanguard. Earth is dying. But humanity will not. We go to claim what's ours. By force if necessary. By any means required.

She looks to Webb.

VASQUEZ (CONT'D)
Engage warp drive.

Webb's finger hovers over the control. He presses it.

EXT. SPACE - ARES PRIME

The ship shimmers. Space compresses ahead of it, expands behind. 

And in an instant that takes no time at all -

It's gone.

INT. ARES PRIME - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

From the crew's perspective, nothing changes. One moment Earth orbit, the next...

HELM OFFICER
We've arrived. Kepler-442 system.

VASQUEZ
Time elapsed?

WEBB
(checking instruments)
Ship time: eighteen seconds.

VASQUEZ
Planetary scan. Claim the--

HELM OFFICER
Admiral. We're receiving automated broadcasts from Earth.

VASQUEZ
Route them through.

A crackling transmission fills the bridge. News broadcasts, but different. The language is the same but the context...

EARTH BROADCAST (V.O.)
...celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the Unity Accords. The Resource Wars, now forty-seven years in our past...

Vasquez's face drains of color.

WEBB
(quiet horror)
The temporal displacement. It's not a prediction. It already happened.

VASQUEZ
How long?

WEBB
From Earth's perspective... forty-seven years have passed.

Silence. The crew processes this. Everything they knew - everyone - is gone.

VASQUEZ
(recovering, forcing command voice)
We knew the risks. Continue mission parameters. Scan for--

HELM OFFICER
Ma'am, we're detecting another ship. Unknown configuration. Also broadcasting... also claiming to be from Earth.

Vasquez and Webb exchange looks.

VASQUEZ
Battle stations.

## SCENE: GUARDIAN SENTINEL LAUNCH (2089)

INT. MILITARY BRIEFING ROOM - EARTH - 2089 - DAY

COLONEL DAVID PARK (41, Korean-American, carries the weight of duty like armor) stands at attention before a wall of monitors showing devastation. The Resource Wars have escalated.

ADMIRAL (V.O.)
(on monitor)
Colonel Park, Guardian Sentinel's mission is clear. Colony ships are en route to three systems via slower-than-light drives. Journey time: eighty years. Your mission is to arrive ahead of them via warp, establish defensive perimeters, and ensure their safe arrival.

PARK
Understood, sir. What are our rules of engagement?

ADMIRAL (V.O.)
Whatever is necessary to protect those colonies. You're their guardian, Colonel. Don't fail them.

Park's jaw tightens.

PARK
Sir, the temporal displacement means--

ADMIRAL (V.O.)
Means you'll never see your family again. You knew that when you volunteered. Dismissed.

The screen goes dark. Park stands alone in the room.

MAJOR SARAH REEVES (36, sharp features, sharper mind) enters.

REEVES
Our crew is assembled. I've run the tactical projections. We have a seventy-eight percent probability of encountering hostile forces at one or more target systems.

PARK
And the colony ships?

REEVES
Will arrive decades after we do, from their perspective. We could be waiting forty, fifty years.

PARK
Then we wait. That's the mission.

Reeves studies him.

REEVES
You believe that? That our lives are worth spending just to wait?

PARK
I believe duty is the only constant in chaos, Major. Launch preparations?

REEVES
Twelve hours. Sir... there are soldiers with families requesting to be relieved from the mission. The displacement numbers just came through.

Park looks at her steadily.

PARK
Inform them that their families will be long dead before we arrive anywhere. Better to have a mission than to have nothing.

He walks past her. Reeves watches him go, something like pity in her eyes.

EXT. GUARDIAN SENTINEL - LAUNCH - DAY

The ship is a fortress - heavy armor plating, point defense systems bristling from every angle. Where Ares Prime was a sword, Guardian Sentinel is a shield.

It launches into gray skies.

INT. GUARDIAN SENTINEL - CHAPEL - EN ROUTE

CHAPLAIN THOMAS OSEI (47, gentle face that's seen too much) conducts a service. The crew has gathered - dozens of faces, young and old.

OSEI
We carry our sins across any distance. But we also carry our hopes. The people we're protecting - the colony ships full of families seeking new homes - they depend on us. Not to be heroes. Just to be present when they need us.

Park sits in the back, hands folded. Reeves beside him.

REEVES
(quiet)
You think prayer helps?

PARK
I think certainty helps. Even if it's false.

REEVES
And if there's no one to protect when we arrive? If the math is wrong and they get there first?

PARK
Then we failed. But at least we tried.

Osei concludes the service. The crew disperses.

OSEI
(approaching Park)
Colonel, a word?

PARK
Chaplain.

OSEI
You're carrying more than duty. I can see it. The Seoul Incident--

PARK
(hard)
Is not your concern.

OSEI
You lost people. So did many of us. But you can't protect everyone by becoming invulnerable yourself.

PARK
Watch me.

He walks away. Osei sighs.

INT. GUARDIAN SENTINEL - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Park takes command. The ship drops out of warp.

Empty space. No colony ships. They're decades early.

PARK
Establish orbital patterns around target system. We wait.

But then--

REEVES
Sir, detecting warp signature. Recent. Within the last six months. And... it's human. Earth configuration.

PARK
Impossible. We should be the first to--

HELM OFFICER
Sir, visual confirmation. It's... it's a warship. Designation: Ares Prime. Records show that ship launched... two years before we did.

Park and Reeves exchange looks.

REEVES
The temporal displacement isn't consistent. They launched first but arrived after us.

PARK
Or we're all arriving out of order. Open hailing frequencies.

## SCENE: ODYSSEY VENTURE LAUNCH (2134)

EXT. EARTH - SPACE - 2134 - DAY

The planet is healing. Visible blue oceans, green continents. White clouds instead of brown dust. 

SUPER: "EARTH, 2134 - THE FIRST UNITY"

INT. EARTH COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

A circular chamber with representatives from every nation. Sunlight streams through glass ceiling. This is a place built for hope.

DR. YUKI KAITO (45, Japanese, carries wisdom and grief in equal measure) addresses the assembly.

KAITO
The Resource Wars taught us the cost of seeing the universe as a zero-sum game. The Reconciliation taught us that cooperation is not weakness - it's survival.

He activates a holographic display showing Kepler-442.

KAITO (CONT'D)
Odyssey Venture will be Earth's first true exploratory mission. Not to conquer. Not to claim. To understand. To learn. And if we encounter others - human or otherwise - to extend the hand of peace first.

COUNCIL DIRECTOR OBI
Dr. Kaito, you're aware of the temporal displacement?

KAITO
I am. We'll arrive decades in the local future. But we carry Earth's values with us - the Earth that learned from its mistakes.

OBI
There are those who say we're sending our best and brightest to die in the future, forgotten.

KAITO
We're sending our best and brightest to plant seeds. What grows from them will be beautiful.

The council votes. Unanimous approval.

INT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - ENGINEERING - LAUNCH DAY

LIEUTENANT AMARA OKONKWO (29, Nigerian, brilliant and pragmatic) runs final checks. The engineering bay is beautiful - clean lines, flowing curves, everything designed for both function and form.

DR. PRIYA VENKATARAMAN (51, Indian, anthropologist and first contact specialist) watches over her shoulder.

VENKATARAMAN
The mathematics are beautiful. You've outdone yourself.

OKONKWO
Math doesn't lie. People do. I trust the math.

VENKATARAMAN
What about the captain?

OKONKWO
Captain Kaito is a scientist. He understands that engineering constraints are real. That's enough for me.

VENKATARAMAN
He's also an idealist. What happens when idealism meets hard limits?

OKONKWO
(smiling)
Then I remind him of the math. Warp drive is ready. We're green across the board.

She pats the warp core housing affectionately. The hum is almost musical compared to the harsh roar of Ares Prime.

EXT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - LAUNCH

The ship is gorgeous - white and silver, flowing lines, observation decks with transparent aluminum allowing panoramic views. Gardens visible inside the rotating sections. This is a ship built for living, not just surviving.

It launches into clear blue skies. Billions watch. Children wave from Earth's surface.

INT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Kaito's bridge is circular, collaborative. Stations arranged in a ring so everyone can see each other. Natural lighting. Plants in the corners.

KAITO
All stations report.

OKONKWO
(from engineering, on screen)
Warp drive nominal. Exotic matter stable. Navigation locked.

KAITO
Dr. Venkataraman?

VENKATARAMAN
First contact protocols loaded and active. Universal greeting packages ready in sixteen hundred languages - including mathematical and musical.

KAITO
(smiling)
You're expecting to meet someone?

VENKATARAMAN
I'm expecting the unexpected. Isn't that the point?

Kaito nods, then addresses the crew.

KAITO
We are the Odyssey. We seek not to claim but to understand. Our voyage begins now. Engage warp drive.

The ship shimmers and disappears.

INT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

They arrive. The transition is seamless.

NAVIGATION OFFICER
Kepler-442 system. Arrival confirmed.

KAITO
How long?

OKONKWO (ON SCREEN)
Ship time: twenty-two seconds. Local time... scanning Earth broadcasts... sixty-four years have passed.

Silence. Less shocked than the military crews - they knew and accepted this.

KAITO
(softly)
The Earth we left is history. But its values live in us. Planetary scan--

NAVIGATION OFFICER
Sir, multiple contacts. At least three ships in system. All broadcasting Earth signatures. And... one is broadcasting a military claim to the system.

Kaito's face becomes serious.

KAITO
Humanity got here before us. And they're fighting over it. Open hailing frequencies on all bands. Universal peace greeting, all languages.

VENKATARAMAN
Preparing first contact package. Though I confess, I wasn't expecting to make first contact with ourselves.

---

## SCENE: CELESTIAL BLOOM LAUNCH (2156)

INT. CELESTIAL BLOOM - CONSTRUCTION DOCK - EARTH ORBIT - 2156

The ship is massive, still under construction. It's been under construction for forty years. Generations have been born in this shipyard.

COMMANDER ARIA CHEN (33, Chinese-American, carries the confidence of someone who knows no other home) floats through zero-G sections, checking progress. She was born here.

DR. JONAS HARTMANN (55, German, botanist and historian) floats beside her, older, carrying memories of a planet she's never seen.

HARTMANN
Section Seven's agricultural deck is complete. The orchards are established. We're carrying genetic material from every Earth biome that still exists.

CHEN
And those that don't?

HARTMANN
(sad smile)
Seed vault has samples from the before times. Before the wars. Maybe on Kepler-442, we can bring them back.

CHEN
You talk about Earth like it's already gone.

HARTMANN
For me, it is. I was born in 2101. The Earth I remember - green Germany, clean rivers, birds everywhere - that Earth died decades ago. Even though it's healing now, it's not the same. I'm carrying ghosts, Aria.

CHEN
Then we'll give those ghosts a garden to haunt.

They reach a massive transparent section. Below, Earth rotates in pristine blue and green.

HARTMANN
You've never stood on it.

CHEN
No. And I never will. By the time we reach Kepler-442, the Earth down there will have changed again. We're all orphans of time now, Jonas.

HARTMANN
Then we build a home that doesn't depend on time.

INT. CELESTIAL BLOOM - COMMAND CENTER - LAUNCH DAY

Unlike the military bridges, this is a civic space. Families present. Children. This is a multi-generational ship becoming a colony ship with warp retrofitting.

Chen addresses the assembly. Hundreds of faces - three generations, some who remember Earth, most who don't.

CHEN
We are Celestial Bloom. We've been building this ship for forty years. Some of you helped lay the first bulkhead. Some of you were born in these corridors. We were meant to travel for two hundred years on slower-than-light drives. But Earth gave us the warp drive. We can reach our destination in weeks instead of centuries.

Murmurs through the crowd.

CHEN (CONT'D)
The temporal displacement means we'll arrive in Kepler-442's future. The Earth we leave today will be history when we arrive. But that's always been true for us. We've been living in our own time since this ship was laid down. We go to build something new. Not to replace Earth. To expand what Earth can be.

DR. ZARA MALIK (40, Pakistani, Chief Medical Officer, ship-born) steps forward.

MALIK
My grandmother laid the keel of this ship. My mother installed the first life support systems. I delivered sixteen babies in our medical bay. This ship IS home. Kepler-442 is just... a bigger garden.

Applause. Chen smiles.

CHEN
Then let's take our home to the stars. Engage warp drive.

EXT. CELESTIAL BLOOM - WARP

The ship is organic-looking - flowing curves, transparent sections showing green gardens inside, rotating sections for gravity. It doesn't look like it should fly. But it does.

It warps.

INT. CELESTIAL BLOOM - OBSERVATION DECK - ARRIVAL

Chen and Hartmann stand at the massive viewport. Kepler-442b hangs before them - blue and green, untouched.

HARTMANN
It's perfect.

CHEN
It's ours to preserve, not possess.

NAVIGATION (V.O.)
Commander Chen, we're detecting multiple vessels. At least eight ships. All claiming to be from Earth. Different eras. And... they're in a standoff.

Chen and Hartmann exchange looks.

CHEN
We left a unified Earth. What did we arrive to?

NAVIGATION (V.O.)
Picking up transmissions. Military claims, territorial disputes, and... one ship broadcasting peace protocols.

HARTMANN
We're watching humanity meet itself across time.

CHEN
And they're fighting over our new home.

## SCENE: PROMETHEUS ARRAY LAUNCH (2103)

INT. RESEARCH FACILITY - EARTH - 2103 - DAY

Cold, functional. This is science, not military. DR. RASHIDA AL-HAMADI (42, Egyptian-British, brilliant and haunted by her own intelligence) presents to a committee of scientists.

AL-HAMADI
The temporal displacement is not a bug. It's a feature of spacetime. We cannot travel faster than light without traveling through time. Every warp jump is, effectively, a one-way trip to the future.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 1
Dr. Al-Hamadi, you're proposing we send a research vessel knowing the crew will never return to their own time?

AL-HAMADI
I'm proposing we send ourselves. Everyone on Prometheus Array is a volunteer who understands the mathematics. We go to study the problem. If there's a solution, we'll find it. If there isn't... we'll map the temporal wake so others can navigate it.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 2
The "temporal wake." Explain.

AL-HAMADI
Every warp ship creates displacement patterns. Like ripples. If enough ships jump in the same region, the ripples interfere. Could destabilize local spacetime. Prometheus Array will map these patterns, establish safe navigation protocols.

COMMANDER LEO TCHAIKOVSKY (38, Russian-American, former concert pianist turned navigator) steps forward with holographic models.

TCHAIKOVSKY
I've visualized Dr. Al-Hamadi's mathematics. Each warp jump is like a note in spacetime. Harmonious jumps create stability. Dissonant jumps create chaos. We need to learn the music of the universe.

The committee members look at each other.

COMMITTEE MEMBER 1
You're both aware this is suicide?

AL-HAMADI
No. It's sacrifice. There's a difference.

The committee approves.

INT. PROMETHEUS ARRAY - LAUNCH DAY

The ship bristles with sensors, antennae, collection arrays. It looks more like a space station than a ship - modular, industrial, beautiful in its purpose.

Al-Hamadi and Tchaikovsky stand on the bridge with DR. KENJI SATO (50, Japanese-American, AI ethics specialist).

SATO
All predictive algorithms are active. The AI is ready to process decades of data.

AL-HAMADI
We'll need it. We're studying a phenomenon that happens faster than thought.

TCHAIKOVSKY
I've composed something. For the launch.

He plays a holographic piano interface. A haunting melody fills the bridge - mathematical and emotional in equal measure.

AL-HAMADI
"Ode to Those Who Leave"?

TCHAIKOVSKY
"Ode to Those Who Choose." We're choosing this, Rashida. Knowledge over comfort. Understanding over home.

AL-HAMADI
Let's hope the universe appreciates the gesture. Engage warp drive.

The ship disappears.

INT. PROMETHEUS ARRAY - LABORATORY - ARRIVAL

Banks of screens showing data. Al-Hamadi processes information at inhuman speed, fingers flying across interfaces.

TCHAIKOVSKY
How long?

AL-HAMADI
From Earth's perspective, sixty-one years. From ours... twenty-nine seconds.

TCHAIKOVSKY
And the temporal wake?

AL-HAMADI
(stopping, horror dawning)
Leo. Look at this.

She projects a four-dimensional map. Hundreds of warp signatures scattered across time and space.

AL-HAMADI (CONT'D)
We're not alone. Ships have been launching from Earth for decades. Different eras, different missions. And they're all converging.

TCHAIKOVSKY
Converging where?

AL-HAMADI
Here. Kepler-442. The gravitational anomaly creates a temporal harbor. Ships from across a century of Earth history are going to meet in the same spatial region within years of each other.

TCHAIKOVSKY
Humanity meeting itself.

AL-HAMADI
Across timelines we can't reconcile. Earth 2087 and Earth 2156 might as well be different species. What happens when they're forced to share the same space?

TCHAIKOVSKY
We find out. Three ships already in system. More arriving.

Sato enters.

SATO
The AI has made a prediction. Probability of armed conflict between temporal factions: eighty-seven percent.

AL-HAMADI
Then we have work to do.

## ACT TWO: CONVERGENCE

## SCENE: FIRST CONTACT WITH OURSELVES

EXT. SPACE - KEPLER-442 SYSTEM

Five ships hang in space, maintaining wary distances. The visual contrast is striking:

- ARES PRIME: Gray, angular, weapons bristling
- GUARDIAN SENTINEL: Fortress-like, heavy armor
- PROMETHEUS ARRAY: Sensor arrays extending like antennae
- ODYSSEY VENTURE: Elegant white curves, gardens visible through transparent sections
- CELESTIAL BLOOM: Massive, organic-looking, rotating sections

INT. ARES PRIME - BRIDGE

Vasquez studies the tactical display. Webb stands at her shoulder.

WEBB
The white ship - Odyssey Venture - their configuration suggests no weapons. At all.

VASQUEZ
Then they're fools. Hail them.

COMMUNICATIONS
Admiral, they're hailing us. Audio only. Universal peace greeting in... it's reading forty languages simultaneously.

VASQUEZ
Put them through.

KAITO (V.O.)
(warm, genuine)
This is Captain Dr. Yuki Kaito of the Odyssey Venture, launched from Earth in the year 2134. We come in peace and in curiosity. We mean no harm and claim no territory. We wish only to understand.

Vasquez and Webb exchange looks. Webb's face shows hope. Vasquez's shows skepticism.

VASQUEZ
This is Admiral Elena Vasquez, Ares Prime, Earth 2087. This system is under military jurisdiction. State your intentions.

Silence. Then:

KAITO (V.O.)
Admiral... 2087? You're from before the Reconciliation. Before the wars ended.

VASQUEZ
Wars don't end, Captain. They pause. You said 2134. Forty-seven years in my future.

KAITO (V.O.)
And sixty-four in my past. Admiral, the Resource Wars ended in 2105. Earth unified in 2131. We've lived in peace for--

VASQUEZ
(cutting transmission)
Lies or naivete. Either way, useless.

WEBB
Admiral, what if he's telling the truth? What if Earth did unify? What if--

VASQUEZ
What if doesn't win wars, Marcus. Reality does. That ship has no weapons because they come from a fantasy world. We come from the real one.

WEBB
Or they come from the world we were trying to build.

Vasquez turns to him sharply.

VASQUEZ
Colonel, are you questioning my command?

WEBB
I'm questioning whether we're still fighting a war that ended decades ago.

INT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - BRIDGE

Kaito sits back, troubled. Okonkwo and Venkataraman watch him.

OKONKWO
They cut us off. Not exactly the warm reception you hoped for.

KAITO
They're from 2087. The Resource Wars were still raging. They probably launched with orders to claim this system by force.

VENKATARAMAN
And we arrived telling them their world-view is obsolete. That probably didn't help.

KAITO
We need to try again. If they're from our past, they need to know they didn't fail. That it got better.

OKONKWO
And if they don't care? If they're still following orders from an Earth that doesn't exist anymore?

KAITO
Then we prove to them that peace is possible. We have to try, Amara. It's who we are.

He reopens the channel.

KAITO (CONT'D)
Admiral Vasquez, I understand your skepticism. But I'm going to keep trying. Because fifty-three years ago - your time - people like you fought and died hoping for a better future. You're looking at it. I'm proof your sacrifice meant something.

Long pause.

VASQUEZ (V.O.)
(quietly)
Don't presume to know what my sacrifice means, Captain.

But she doesn't cut the connection.

INT. GUARDIAN SENTINEL - BRIDGE

Park watches the exchange between Ares Prime and Odyssey Venture play out on his screens. Reeves stands beside him.

REEVES
Two Earth ships. Different eras. Already at odds. This is going to get worse.

PARK
We have our orders. Protect the colony ships when they arrive.

REEVES
Sir, according to the temporal math, the colony ships arrived and settled thirty years ago. Local time. Our mission is obsolete.

Park's jaw clenches.

PARK
That's impossible. We launched two years after Ares Prime. We should have arrived first.

REEVES
Temporal displacement isn't consistent. Variables include jump distance, gravitational fields, exotic matter calibration. We launched later but arrived earlier. The colony ships we're meant to protect launched via slower-than-light drives in 2091 but received warp drive retrofit in 2145. They're already here.

PARK
Show me.

Reeves brings up sensor data. A massive ship - Celestial Bloom - reading as a thriving colony vessel.

REEVES
That's our mission, sir. Already completed. Without us.

Park stares at the screen. His entire purpose evaporating.

PARK
Hail them.

INT. CELESTIAL BLOOM - COMMAND CENTER

Chen receives the hail. Hartmann at her side.

CHEN
This is Commander Aria Chen, Celestial Bloom colony vessel.

PARK (V.O.)
Commander, I'm Colonel David Park, Guardian Sentinel. We... we were sent to protect you. To ensure your safe arrival.

Chen looks confused.

CHEN
Guardian Sentinel? I don't have any record of escort protection in our mission parameters.

PARK (V.O.)
Because we launched in 2089. You launched in 2156. We were meant to arrive first, establish defensive perimeters, and wait for slower colony ships.

Understanding dawns on Chen's face.

CHEN
Colonel... we received warp drive retrofit in 2145. We arrived six months ago, local time. We've already begun establishing our colony on Kepler-442b.

Silence from Guardian Sentinel.

CHEN (CONT'D)
Colonel Park, you... you gave up everything to protect us. And we didn't need protection. I'm so sorry.

PARK (V.O.)
(voice tight)
Not your fault, Commander. Temporal displacement. The universe's idea of a joke.

CHEN
Colonel, would you like to visit? See what you helped make possible? Your sacrifice wasn't meaningless. We're here. We're thriving. That's because of soldiers like you.

Long pause.

PARK (V.O.)
I'd... I'd like that. Thank you, Commander.

The connection closes. In Guardian Sentinel's bridge, Park sits heavily in his command chair.

REEVES
Sir, what are our orders now?

PARK
(hollow)
I don't know.

## SCENE: WEBB'S DEFECTION

INT. ARES PRIME - WEBB'S QUARTERS - NIGHT (SHIP TIME)

Webb can't sleep. He's been reviewing Odyssey Venture's broadcasts - their scientific papers, their mission parameters, their world view.

Everything he's reading says Earth unified. The wars ended. Peace became possible.

On his screen: a research paper by Okonkwo on warp engineering ethics. Another by Kaito on universal cooperation frameworks.

These are scientists who build instead of destroy.

He looks at his own research files. Weapons. Every equation an instrument of death.

WEBB
(to himself)
It got better. It actually got better.

He makes a decision.

INT. ARES PRIME - BRIDGE - MORNING (SHIP TIME)

Vasquez reviews tactical options. Webb approaches.

WEBB
Admiral, I need to speak with you.

VASQUEZ
Make it quick, Colonel.

WEBB
I'm resigning my commission. Effective immediately.

Vasquez turns, shocked.

VASQUEZ
What?

WEBB
I've been in contact with Odyssey Venture's science team. They've offered me a position. Research. Pure research. No weapons.

VASQUEZ
(standing, angry)
You're defecting? To those naive fools?

WEBB
I'm choosing which future to serve. The one we were afraid of or the one we hoped for.

VASQUEZ
We don't know if their world is real. It could be propaganda.

WEBB
Or it could be proof that what we did mattered. That people like you fought so people like them could exist. Admiral... Earth unified. We won. Not the way we expected, but we won.

VASQUEZ
By surrendering everything that made us strong.

WEBB
By becoming something better than strong. By becoming wise.

He places his rank insignia on her console.

WEBB (CONT'D)
I've programmed the autonomous shuttle. I'm leaving in ten minutes. You could stop me. You should probably court-martial me. But I'm hoping you won't.

VASQUEZ
Why would I let you go?

WEBB
Because part of you wants to believe I'm right. That it got better. That your war wasn't for nothing.

Vasquez's hand hovers over the internal security alert.

VASQUEZ
If you're wrong about them...

WEBB
Then I chose badly. But at least I chose. Thank you, Admiral. For everything you taught me.

He salutes. After a long moment, Vasquez returns it.

She doesn't trigger the alert.

EXT. SPACE - SHUTTLE TRANSFER

A small shuttle crosses from Ares Prime to Odyssey Venture. Vasquez watches from her bridge viewport.

VASQUEZ
(quietly)
Good luck, Marcus.

INT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - DOCKING BAY

The shuttle docks. Webb emerges, carrying a single bag. Kaito, Okonkwo, and Venkataraman wait.

KAITO
Dr. Webb. Welcome.

WEBB
I'm not a defector. I just... I needed to see if this was real.

OKONKWO
What convinced you?

WEBB
Your research papers. Warp engineering ethics. You wrote about responsibility for what we create. I've been building weapons my entire career. I want to build something else. Anything else.

Kaito extends his hand. Webb takes it.

KAITO
Then welcome aboard. Let's show you what science can be.

Webb's eyes fill with tears.

## SCENE: THE PROMETHEUS WARNING

INT. PROMETHEUS ARRAY - LABORATORY

Al-Hamadi hasn't slept in thirty-six hours. Screens surround her showing four-dimensional maps of spacetime stress patterns.

Tchaikovsky and Sato watch, concerned.

TCHAIKOVSKY
Rashida, you need rest.

AL-HAMADI
I'm close. I'm so close. Look at this.

She projects the data. Warp signatures layered on top of each other, creating interference patterns.

AL-HAMADI (CONT'D)
Every warp jump creates ripples in spacetime. Small, usually harmless. But here, at Kepler-442, the gravitational anomaly amplifies them. Five ships have arrived. But look at the long-range sensors.

She zooms out. Dozens more warp signatures, approaching.

SATO
That's... that's more than fifty ships.

AL-HAMADI
Fifty-three by my count. Launched from Earth between 2091 and 2180. Different factions, different missions, different eras. And they're all converging here within the next eight months.

TCHAIKOVSKY
Why here?

AL-HAMADI
The gravitational lens. It creates what I'm calling a temporal harbor - a region where temporal displacement is more predictable, more stable. Ships naturally converge here.

SATO
The AI has updated its predictions. With fifty-three ships in the same spatial region, all from different temporal origins...

He pauses, face grave.

SATO (CONT'D)
Probability of armed conflict: ninety-four percent. Probability of coordinated warp jumps causing spacetime instability: seventy-eight percent.

AL-HAMADI
We need to warn everyone. Now.

She opens a broad-spectrum channel.

AL-HAMADI (CONT'D)
This is Dr. Rashida Al-Hamadi of Prometheus Array to all vessels in Kepler-442 system. I have critical data regarding spacetime stability. We need to coordinate immediately. If we don't...

She looks at the data.

AL-HAMADI (CONT'D)
If we don't, the temporal wake will collapse. And it will take all of us with it.

## [SERIES VERSION: END EPISODE 2 / CONTINUE FOR FILM]

## SCENE: THE CONVERGENCE SUMMIT

INT. CELESTIAL BLOOM - CONFERENCE HALL - DAY

Chen has offered Celestial Bloom as neutral ground. The five ship commanders gather around a circular table - a deliberate choice.

Present:
- Admiral VASQUEZ (Ares Prime, 2087)
- Dr. KAITO (Odyssey Venture, 2134)  
- Colonel PARK (Guardian Sentinel, 2089)
- Commander CHEN (Celestial Bloom, 2156)
- Dr. AL-HAMADI (Prometheus Array, 2103)

Also present as advisors:
- Major REEVES (Guardian Sentinel)
- Lieutenant OKONKWO (Odyssey Venture)
- Dr. WEBB (formerly Ares Prime, now Odyssey Venture)
- Commander TCHAIKOVSKY (Prometheus Array)
- Dr. HARTMANN (Celestial Bloom)

The tension is palpable.

CHEN
(standing, formal)
Thank you for coming. We're here because we're all from Earth. Different Earths, apparently, but still the same origin. That has to count for something.

VASQUEZ
It counts for nothing if we can't agree on basic principles. My Earth was at war. Captain Kaito's Earth was unified. Colonel Park's Earth was collapsing. We don't share values.

KAITO
We share biology. We share the same home planet. We share the fact that we're all temporal refugees now, cut off from our origins. That's enough to start with.

PARK
The captain is right. We're all orphaned from our timelines. Fighting each other accomplishes nothing except making us more alone.

REEVES
With respect, Colonel, survival isn't about feelings. It's about resources. Kepler-442 is habitable. If fifty more ships arrive, all wanting to settle here, we'll have conflict regardless of our good intentions.

CHEN
Then we make it clear: Celestial Bloom was designed as a colony ship. We're already establishing settlement. We claim no territorial sovereignty, but we do claim the right to complete our mission. Anyone else is welcome to share the system or move on.

VASQUEZ
You claim no sovereignty but you're settling the best real estate. That's a claim whether you admit it or not.

AL-HAMADI
(cutting in)
This is all irrelevant if we're dead. Which we will be if we don't coordinate our actions.

She stands and projects the holographic data - the spacetime stress patterns.

AL-HAMADI (CONT'D)
The Kepler-442 system is accumulating temporal stress. Every warp arrival adds to it. When we hit critical mass - which I calculate will happen when approximately sixty ships have converged - spacetime will catastrophically destabilize.

OKONKWO
What does that mean in practical terms?

AL-HAMADI
It means the fabric of reality tears. Locally. We're talking about a region of space where physics stops working predictably. Gravity fluctuations, temporal distortions, possible collapse into a singularity.

TCHAIKOVSKY
I've been mapping the patterns. Think of spacetime as a musical instrument. Each warp jump is a note. Harmonious notes create chords. Dissonant notes create noise. We're approaching cacophony.

WEBB
Is there a solution?

AL-HAMADI
Coordinated departure. We leave in sequence, staggered timing, different vectors. Spread the temporal load across spacetime instead of concentrating it. But it requires everyone to cooperate. Everyone to follow precise calculations. One ship jumping early or late could destabilize everything.

VASQUEZ
You're asking me to put my crew's survival in your hands.

AL-HAMADI
I'm asking you to trust mathematics.

VASQUEZ
I trust weapons. I trust armor. I don't trust theories.

KAITO
Admiral, I understand your skepticism. Your Earth taught you to trust only strength. But my Earth learned that cooperation is strength. We survived because we worked together.

VASQUEZ
Your Earth was soft. Weak. You said it yourself - peace came after the wars ended. Because people like me fought them.

KAITO
People like you made peace possible. But people like me made it real. We're both necessary. The seed and the garden.

Park speaks quietly.

PARK
I spent my entire life following orders. My mission was to arrive first and wait decades to protect colony ships. But I arrived late and the colony ships didn't need protection. My entire purpose was obsolete before I arrived.

He looks at Chen.

PARK (CONT'D)
But Commander Chen didn't tell me I was useless. She didn't tell me I wasted my life. She thanked me. Because my sacrifice - my willingness to give up everything - was part of the chain that led to her success.

He turns to Vasquez.

PARK (CONT'D)
Admiral, you and I launched from the same era. We understand each other. But these people - they're proof we didn't fail. Earth didn't die. It grew. Maybe we can too.

Vasquez meets his eyes. For the first time, uncertainty crosses her face.

HARTMANN
(standing, elderly voice but strong)
I'm the oldest person in this room. I was born in 2101. I remember the tail end of the Resource Wars. I remember the dust storms, the rationing, the fear. I also remember the first day I saw clear sky again - 2119, I was eighteen. I cried for an hour.

He looks around the table.

HARTMANN (CONT'D)
I'm also the only person here who directly remembers Earth before any of your ships launched. That Earth is gone. It exists only in my memory and in the seeds I carry. Every Earth each of you represents is gone too. We're all carrying ghosts.

He places his hands on the table.

HARTMANN (CONT'D)
But ghosts can build new homes. If we let them. If we choose to.

Silence.

CHEN
Dr. Al-Hamadi, how long do we have?

AL-HAMADI
Fourteen hours before the next wave of ships arrives. Once they do, we're past the point of safe departure for the existing vessels. We'll be trapped until we coordinate with the new arrivals. Which means more delay, more risk, more complexity.

CHEN
Then we have fourteen hours to decide who we are. Are we Earth fighting itself across time? Or are we something new?

VASQUEZ
(quietly)
Easy for you to say. Your Earth was united. Mine was at war.

CHEN
I was born on this ship. I've never stood on Earth. I don't represent any Earth. I represent the hope that we can be more than our origins.

Vasquez looks at her for a long moment. Then at Park. Then at Kaito.

VASQUEZ
If I agree to Dr. Al-Hamadi's coordination plan... I need assurances. Ares Prime leaves with full autonomy. No one dictates our next destination.

AL-HAMADI
Agreed. I'm coordinating departures, not missions.

VASQUEZ
And the colony on Kepler-442b remains open to all human factions. No exclusive claims.

CHEN
I already said that.

VASQUEZ
I need to hear it as policy, not philosophy.

Chen extends her hand across the table.

CHEN
Kepler-442b is open to all Earth-origin ships. Any era, any faction. We build together or we build in parallel, but we build in peace.

Vasquez looks at the hand. Around the table, everyone holds their breath.

She takes it.

VASQUEZ
Against my better judgment... we have an accord.

Relief ripples through the room.

PARK
The Kepler Accord.

KAITO
A fitting name.

AL-HAMADI
Good. Now let's make sure we all survive long enough to honor it.

## [FILM VERSION: CONTINUE TO CLIMAX / SERIES VERSION: END EPISODE 4]

## ACT THREE: TEMPORAL RECKONING

## SCENE: THE FLEETS ARRIVE

EXT. SPACE - KEPLER-442 SYSTEM - VARIOUS ANGLES

Over a montage, we see three massive fleets arrive:

**COLONIAL EXPANSION ARMADA** - Forty warships, brutal and efficient, warp in with military precision. They're painted in dark colors, bristling with weapons.

**UNITY EXPEDITIONARY FORCE** - Twenty-five ships, scientific and exploratory, warp in broadcasting peace on all frequencies. Clean white hulls, observation domes.

**PRESERVATION PROTOCOL** - Fifteen massive vessels, strange and organic-looking, half-biological technology. Unsettling to look at.

The five original ships watch from their dispersed positions.

INT. PROMETHEUS ARRAY - BRIDGE

Al-Hamadi's screens go red with alerts.

AL-HAMADI
We're out of time. Eighty-three ships now in system. Spacetime stress at critical levels.

TCHAIKOVSKY
The music has become noise. Beautiful, terrible noise.

SATO
The AI predicts catastrophic failure in sixteen hours if no coordinated action is taken.

AL-HAMADI
Contact all vessels. We need to brief them on the danger.

EXT. KEPLER-442B - SURFACE - DESIGNATED LANDING ZONE

A temporary habitat has been constructed. Representatives from all factions gather. 

This is bigger than the five-ship meeting. This is fractured humanity facing itself.

Notable attendees:
- ADMIRAL-GENERAL VIKTOR PETROV (Colonial Armada) - hard-faced, Russian, represents aggressive expansion philosophy
- COUNCIL DIRECTOR AMARA OBI (Unity Force) - Nigerian, diplomatic, represents democratic cooperation
- COLLECTIVE SPEAKER (Preservation Protocol) - appears human but moves uncannily, represents post-human future
- The five original ship commanders

INT. HABITAT - SUMMIT HALL

Petrov stands first, dominates the space through physical presence.

PETROV
I am Admiral-General Viktor Petrov. My fleet represents Earth 2091 through 2115. We launched during the darkest days of the Resource Wars. Our mission is clear: claim habitable worlds before our enemies can. Kepler-442 is ours by right of arrival and strength.

VASQUEZ
I launched in 2087. I was here first. Your claim is invalid.

PETROV
(turning to her, sizing her up)
Admiral Vasquez. Ares Prime. I know your ship from the history files. Obsolete doctrine. Outdated weapons. You're from before the Collapse Accords. Your rank isn't even recognized in my command structure.

VASQUEZ
(controlled anger)
I don't need your recognition. I have firepower.

PETROV
(laughs)
As do I. More of it.

COUNCIL DIRECTOR OBI
(standing, commanding attention with calm presence)
This is exactly the kind of thinking that nearly destroyed Earth. I represent the Unity Expeditionary Force, launched between 2135 and 2149. Our Earth learned from the Resource Wars. We watched billions die over territory that meant nothing once people were dead to claim it.

She looks around the room.

OBI (CONT'D)
Kepler-442 is habitable for all of us. There is room. There are resources. We don't need to fight over it unless we choose to.

PETROV
Easy to say when your Earth had fusion power and abundance. My Earth is starving. We need this planet.

CHEN
Then we'll share it. Celestial Bloom has agricultural technology, genetic seed banks, everything needed to establish food production. We'll help you.

PETROV
Why?

CHEN
Because you're hungry.

The simple answer stops him.

The COLLECTIVE SPEAKER stands - or rather unfolds. Its movements are fluid, inhuman.

COLLECTIVE SPEAKER
This discussion is inefficient. We are Preservation Protocol. We represent humanity 2160 through 2180. We have transcended individual biological limitations. We are partially synthetic, partially organic, fully integrated with AI consciousness.

Murmurs through the room. Some fearful, some fascinated.

COLLECTIVE SPEAKER (CONT'D)
Kepler-442 is optimal for preservation seeding. We will establish backup consciousness libraries here. Territorial disputes are irrelevant to post-biological entities. We will proceed regardless of consensus.

KAITO
With respect, Collective Speaker, this system contains other humans. Biological humans. Our needs may differ from yours.

COLLECTIVE SPEAKER
Your needs are temporary. Biological form is temporary. Only preserved consciousness is permanent. We are humanity's future.

HARTMANN
(standing, angry)
You're humanity's nightmare. I fought to preserve life, not to upload it to servers.

COLLECTIVE SPEAKER
You are limited by nostalgia for obsolete forms.

PARK
(standing, commanding)
Enough. We're not here to debate philosophy. We're here to prevent a catastrophe.

He nods to Al-Hamadi.

PARK (CONT'D)
Dr. Al-Hamadi has critical information. Everyone needs to hear it.

AL-HAMADI
(standing, projecting data)
Eighty-three ships are now in this system. Each warp arrival has added stress to local spacetime. We've reached critical mass. If even five ships attempt to warp out simultaneously, the interference will create a temporal shockwave.

PETROV
What does that mean?

AL-HAMADI
It means spacetime tears. Reality stops functioning predictably in this region. Everything here - every ship, every person - could be destroyed. Or worse, scattered across time in random directions.

OBI
Can you prevent this?

AL-HAMADI
Yes. But it requires perfect coordination. Every ship must depart on a precise schedule, following exact vectors I'll provide. The departure sequence will take seventy-two hours. Any deviation, any ship jumping early or late, could trigger the cascade failure.

PETROV
You're asking us to put our survival in your hands?

AL-HAMADI
I'm asking you to trust mathematics.

PETROV
I trust firepower.

VASQUEZ
(surprising everyone)
I used to say the same thing. But Dr. Al-Hamadi's mathematics saved my ship once already. If she says we're all in danger, we're in danger.

Petrov looks at Vasquez with surprise.

PETROV
You're agreeing with them? You're from the wars. You understand reality.

VASQUEZ
I'm from your past, Admiral-General. And I'm telling you - trust her or die. Those are your options.

---

## SCENE: WEBB'S SACRIFICE

INT. PROMETHEUS ARRAY - LABORATORY

Al-Hamadi works frantically, calculating departure vectors. Webb is with her, running simulations.

WEBB
Something's wrong. The departure sequence keeps failing in the simulations.

AL-HAMADI
I see it. There's a pre-existing instability. An incomplete warp bubble from... three weeks ago. One of the Unity Force ships had an emergency shutdown. The bubble didn't fully collapse.

WEBB
Can you calculate around it?

AL-HAMADI
No. It's causing interference with every projection. The bubble is still manifested, partially, in subspace. It's like a wound in spacetime that won't heal.

WEBB
Can we collapse it?

AL-HAMADI
Theoretically. It would require someone to fly directly into the phenomenon with a counter-field generator. The interaction would collapse the bubble.

WEBB
How dangerous?

AL-HAMADI
For the person doing it? Fatal. The energy release would destroy anything in the immediate vicinity.

Webb is quiet for a moment.

WEBB
I'll do it.

AL-HAMADI
Marcus, no. Let me find another way.

WEBB
There isn't time. You said yourself, we have hours before more ships arrive and make coordination impossible. If I don't do this now, everyone dies.

He stands.

WEBB (CONT'D)
I spent my career building weapons. Let me save people instead.

INT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - BRIDGE

Kaito receives Webb's transmission.

WEBB (ON SCREEN)
Captain, I'm taking a shuttle from Prometheus Array. There's an unstable warp bubble that needs to be collapsed. It's interfering with Dr. Al-Hamadi's departure calculations.

KAITO
Marcus, what aren't you telling me?

WEBB
(slight smile)
That I'm glad I met you. That you showed me what I was supposed to be.

KAITO
(understanding dawning)
No. Marcus, there has to be another way.

WEBB
There isn't. And I've made peace with it. I'm not running from something anymore. I'm running toward something.

OKONKWO
(on screen, in engineering, tears in her eyes)
Dr. Webb, your equations... they're beautiful. You taught me that engineering is about what we choose to build.

WEBB
Remember that. Build beautiful things, Amara.

INT. ARES PRIME - BRIDGE

Vasquez watches the same transmission.

VASQUEZ
(to herself)
Damn it, Marcus.

She opens a channel.

VASQUEZ (CONT'D)
Dr. Webb. This is Admiral Vasquez.

WEBB (ON SCREEN)
Admiral.

VASQUEZ
You were the best officer I ever served with. I didn't realize it until you left. But you were. You're a better person than I'll ever be.

WEBB
(genuinely)
No, Admiral. I'm just the person you made possible. Thank you for letting me go.

INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS

Webb pilots alone toward the spatial coordinates where the unstable bubble lurks. His shuttle's sensors show the distortion - a shimmer in spacetime.

He activates the counter-field generator he's jury-rigged.

WEBB
(to himself)
Let this be enough. Let this mean something.

He flies into the distortion.

EXT. SPACE - SHUTTLE

The shuttle enters the shimmering region. For a moment, nothing happens.

Then - a brilliant flash. The warp bubble collapses, releasing stored energy. The shuttle is vaporized instantly.

Webb doesn't suffer. It's over in less than a second.

INT. PROMETHEUS ARRAY - LABORATORY

Al-Hamadi watches her screens. The interference pattern disappears.

AL-HAMADI
(whisper)
It worked. Marcus... it worked.

She wipes her eyes and gets back to work. His sacrifice cannot be wasted.

INT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - BRIDGE

Kaito sits in silence. Okonkwo joins him.

OKONKWO
He saved us all.

KAITO
He saved us twice. Once by defecting. Once by dying. Both times by choosing who he wanted to be.

---

## SCENE: THE KEPLER ACCORD

INT. HABITAT - SUMMIT HALL - HOURS LATER

The representatives gather again. The mood is somber. They all know about Webb's sacrifice.

CHEN
(standing)
Dr. Marcus Webb gave his life to give us this chance. We can coordinate departure now. Dr. Al-Hamadi has the calculations ready. But before we leave... we need to establish principles.

OBI
The Council Director is right. We're about to scatter across the stars again. Different destinations, different missions. But we're all human. We need common ground.

PETROV
What are you proposing?

PARK
The Kepler Accord. A set of principles for temporal coexistence.

He projects a document. The text is simple:

**THE KEPLER ACCORD**

1. **Temporal Recognition**: All ships from all Earth eras are recognized as legitimate representatives of their launch-period values. No faction may claim primacy.

2. **Territorial Neutrality**: Kepler-442 is declared neutral territory. Celestial Bloom colony has settlement rights as non-governmental entity. All other claims are void.

3. **Navigation Protocols**: Prometheus Array temporal wake navigation guidelines are adopted universally to prevent future convergences without consent.

4. **Military Non-Aggression**: No first-strike actions between ships of Earth origin, regardless of temporal or ideological differences. Defensive rights maintained.

5. **Communication Network**: All ships must broadcast position and origin era using standardized protocols to prevent accidental conflicts.

6. **Cultural Exchange**: Each ship/faction maintains archives of their era's Earth history. Shared database created for all humanity's branches.

7. **Resource Sharing**: Ships in distress will be aided regardless of faction. Basic humanitarian principles transcend temporal differences.

REEVES
You're asking standing militaries to pledge non-aggression to potential enemies.

PARK
I'm asking us to stop seeing each other as enemies. We're all from Earth. That has to mean something.

VASQUEZ
I'll sign it. On one condition.

Everyone looks at her.

VASQUEZ (CONT'D)
Ares Prime stands down as active military vessel. We don't have a war to fight anymore. But I want the record to show that we stood down voluntarily. That we chose peace. Not surrender. Choice.

PETROV
If Vasquez signs it, I'll sign it. You're from my past, Admiral. If you can let go of the war, maybe I can too.

OBI
The Unity Expeditionary Force will sign.

COLLECTIVE SPEAKER
The Preservation Protocol... finds these terms acceptable. Though individual biological concerns remain temporary.

HARTMANN
(quietly)
I'll sign it. As witness from the generation that started this mess.

One by one, they approach the document. It's not digital - it's stone. Chen commissioned it.

They press their hands into the wet stone, leaving prints.

When they're done, the monument shows dozens of handprints in various sizes. The text is etched below.

CHEN
"Here, humanity met itself and chose peace."

---

## SCENE: DEPARTURES

EXT. KEPLER-442 SYSTEM - SPACE - OVER 72 HOURS

A montage of departures, choreographed by Al-Hamadi's calculations.

Ships depart one by one, different vectors, staggered timing. It's like watching a complex dance.

Each departure is a small flash, then absence.

INT. ARES PRIME - BRIDGE

VASQUEZ
Lieutenant Hayes, you have command. Take her to the Frontier Territories. Establish peace, not conquest.

HAYES
Admiral, you're not coming?

VASQUEZ
I have a new mission. Someone needs to stay here, mediate disputes, uphold the Accord. I spent my life making war. Let me spend what's left making peace.

Hayes salutes. Vasquez returns it.

VASQUEZ
(quietly)
Tell them I tried. Tell them it mattered.

She transfers to a shuttle, heads to Celestial Bloom colony on the surface.

INT. GUARDIAN SENTINEL - BRIDGE

Park addresses his crew.

PARK
Our original mission was obsolete. So we find a new one. We'll establish the Temporal Peacekeepers - a coalition across factions maintaining the Accord. Not enforcers. Mediators. Witnesses.

REEVES
Strange mission for a warship.

PARK
Strange time for soldiers. Major, are you with me?

REEVES
(slight smile)
Better mission than waiting decades for colony ships that don't need us. Yes, sir. I'm with you.

Guardian Sentinel warps out.

INT. ODYSSEY VENTURE - BRIDGE

Kaito looks at Webb's empty science station.

KAITO
Amara, you have first officer duties now.

OKONKWO
Sir, I'm an engineer, not--

KAITO
You're someone who understands that building matters more than breaking. That's exactly what a first officer needs to know. We continue the mission. Exploration. Understanding. Peace.

OKONKWO
Where to?

KAITO
Forward. Always forward. Marcus would want that.

Odyssey Venture warps out.

INT. CELESTIAL BLOOM - CHEN'S QUARTERS

Chen watches other ships depart from her window. Hartmann joins her.

HARTMANN
We're staying?

CHEN
This is home. We build here. And when other ships arrive - and they will - we welcome them. Show them the Accord. Prove it's possible.

HARTMANN
You're young to carry such weight.

CHEN
You're old to plant so many gardens. We're both doing things we weren't supposed to. That's what makes us human.

EXT. KEPLER-442B - SURFACE - COLONY SITE

Vasquez walks through the growing settlement. Gardens. Families. Children playing.

She's traded her military uniform for civilian clothes. It doesn't fit perfectly yet. But she's trying.

A young girl runs up to her.

GIRL
Are you Admiral Vasquez? My dad says you were a hero.

VASQUEZ
I was a soldier. There's a difference.

GIRL
What's the difference?

Vasquez thinks about this.

VASQUEZ
Soldiers fight. Heroes choose when to stop.

The girl runs off. Vasquez watches her go, something like peace settling over her features.

INT. PROMETHEUS ARRAY - LABORATORY

Al-Hamadi stands before her life's work. The complete temporal navigation equations. Perfect coordination. Precise temporal control.

She could publish this. Become the most celebrated physicist in human history.

Or...

She highlights the files. Her finger hovers over DELETE.

TCHAIKOVSKY
(entering)
Are you sure?

AL-HAMADI
If this gets out, someone will weaponize it. Temporal warfare. Coordinated strikes across time. It would tear humanity apart.

TCHAIKOVSKY
But it's your life's work. Your legacy.

AL-HAMADI
My legacy is the Kepler Accord. Everyone alive because we coordinated departure. That's enough.

She presses DELETE.

The equations vanish.

TCHAIKOVSKY
You saved them by destroying your work.

AL-HAMADI
No. I saved them by choosing what knowledge not to share.

She creates a new file. Types a message:

"To future physicists: The temporal wake equations exist. I solved them. But I've chosen not to publish. If you're reading this, you've solved them too. You face the same choice. Choose wisely. Some knowledge is too dangerous. - RA"

She encrypts it with a 500-year time lock.

AL-HAMADI (CONT'D)
Maybe in five hundred years, humanity will be ready. Maybe not. Either way, it's not my problem anymore.

Prometheus Array warps out, continuing its endless research mission.

---

## EPILOGUE: THE TEMPORAL WAKE

FADE TO:

SUPER: "KEPLER-442B, LOCAL YEAR 2215 (EARTH YEAR UNKNOWN)"

EXT. KEPLER-442B - COLONY - DAY

The settlement has become a city. Diverse architecture mixing styles from different Earth eras. Gardens everywhere - Hartmann's legacy.

INT. MEMORIAL HALL

The stone monument with handprints sits in a place of honor. Visitors come to see it.

A tour guide - young, third generation colony-born - leads a school group.

TOUR GUIDE
This is where it started. The Kepler Accord. See the different handprints? Each one represents a different Earth, a different time, a different philosophy. But they all chose peace.

STUDENT
Why did they fight in the first place?

TOUR GUIDE
Because they forgot they were all human. It took meeting themselves across time to remember.

INT. VASQUEZ'S APARTMENT

Vasquez is elderly now, white-haired, but her eyes are still sharp. She trains young mediators.

VASQUEZ
Remember: both sides usually believe they're right. Your job isn't to prove them wrong. It's to find where their "rights" can coexist.

An alert chimes. New ship entering system.

VASQUEZ (CONT'D)
Here we go again. Time to see which Earth arrived this time.

She smiles. This is her purpose now.

EXT. SPACE - KEPLER-442 SYSTEM

A new ship warps in. Unknown configuration.

It broadcasts: "This is the Meridian, launched from Earth year 2201. We've heard about the Kepler Accord. We're seeking refuge from temporal factional conflicts in other systems."

VASQUEZ (V.O.)
(via comm)
Meridian, this is Kepler-442b colony. You're welcome here. Transmitting Accord protocols now. Welcome home.

EXT. LAGRANGE POINT - SPACE

At the stable gravitational point where ships first converged, a permanent buoy has been placed.

It broadcasts continuously on all frequencies, in all known human languages:

BUOY TRANSMISSION (V.O.)
"To all ships from Earth, from any Earth, from any time: You are not alone. You are not lost. We are here. We are each other. Navigate with care. Navigate with hope. The Temporal Wake is wide, but we walk it together. Welcome home. - The Kepler Accord, Year 2198 local, Years 2087-2180 origin, Year unknown destination."

EXT. SPACE - WIDE SHOT

Pull back from Kepler-442. Wider. Wider.

Show the galaxy. Hundreds of warp signatures scattered across time and space. Humanity spreading not as a wave but as a network, nodes connecting across time.

Some paths cross. Some diverge. Some parallel.

It's chaotic. It's beautiful.

FADE TO:

SUPER: "We are the Temporal Wake. We are what we chose to become."

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END

- AL-HAMADI: 40s, brilliant and haunted, carrying burden of knowledge
- WEBB: Late 30s, guilt and hope in equal measure

## FINAL PRODUCTION NOTE

**Temporal Wake** is ultimately about choice. Every character faces the decision to transcend their origins or remain bound by them. The visual language should reinforce this: rigid, angular designs softening to curves; harsh lighting becoming natural; isolated individuals becoming ensembles.

The temporal displacement physics is real consequence driving real drama, but the story is about people choosing who they want to be when everything they knew is gone.

Make it beautiful. Make it hopeful. Make it honest about how hard hope is to maintain.

That's the story.
